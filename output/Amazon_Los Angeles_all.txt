1501274487341260802 2022-03-08 11:11:44 -0800 <joereedy> I wonder if the NFL would kick off the Amazon package with Broncos at Seahawks in Week 2.
1501274179101880324 2022-03-08 11:10:31 -0800 <Curious__JJ> @Ariichiiyoko Amazon cloud services are acting up
1501273315108741121 2022-03-08 11:07:05 -0800 <worldofcrap> @annelisebaer Yeah I think the Air will be more than enough. Just bump the RAM to 16GB and you‚Äôll be good. Also get a $40 USB-C dongle off Amazon and you‚Äôre set.
1501271933014315014 2022-03-08 11:01:35 -0800 <melodramars> me getting desperate and downloading amazon music because it has 3 months free trial
1501271624691027972 2022-03-08 11:00:22 -0800 <everytimeicash> DDOS on multiple prominent sites ongoing currently.   Seeing: Amazon Spotify Youtube Discord among others  $AMZN $SPOT $GOOG $QQQ

1501270222212243459 2022-03-08 10:54:47 -0800 <ScottJenstad> @Gialde @MattWi77iams @drhoa3 It‚Äôs not, and hell, NFL might be going to Amazon prime, and had exclusive nfl network games for years.
1501270088321679362 2022-03-08 10:54:15 -0800 <KyzerZaddy> @Brandonismusic I‚Äôll send you the link from Amazon though!
1501269934805946369 2022-03-08 10:53:39 -0800 <Critiical> Discord is down. I guess it's time to go to Amazon and look at my wishlist to buy stuff to pass the time
1501269609789333505 2022-03-08 10:52:21 -0800 <kostantewicz> Pretty obvious this is the beginning of a series of cyber attacks, Discord, Amazon, and Spotify are just the warning flares. CNN literally sent out a message 10 mins before it started saying ‚ÄúIt might be too late to prevent a cyberattack‚Äù
1501268983013523456 2022-03-08 10:49:52 -0800 <alejroaches> I rely on Spotify like many people rely on Amazon or on their abusive spouses. I guess I‚Äôll go listen to whatever random songs stuck around in my iTunes library. This is a reminder to just create my own music library.
1501268484277211139 2022-03-08 10:47:53 -0800 <Brianniful> Lmao so what we using in the meantime? Pandora? YouTube? Amazon music? #spotifydown

1501266469740421125 2022-03-08 10:39:53 -0800 <ClaireMax> @Donny_B26 Amazon music is powered by Spotify I believe
1501266191578374147 2022-03-08 10:38:46 -0800 <freedomboimk2> Lots of websites/apps having issues per Downdetector.

1501262999742402563 2022-03-08 10:26:05 -0800 <gbaroth> @blakeir but there's no funnel like the tiktok to amazon funnel
1501262273158914050 2022-03-08 10:23:12 -0800 <delafuckincrowe> spotify might be down, but good thing i also have apple music and amazon music üòÇ
1501261626720194562 2022-03-08 10:20:38 -0800 <JennyGeist_> Hey Amazon, when are you gonna start paying your contractors better to make up the difference of the enormous gas prices rn? It's bad enough that you don't pay them for gas but paying a pittance when gas is at record highs? ü§î
1501261328085762055 2022-03-08 10:19:27 -0800 <LordxAndy> My amazon wishlist is so long lol. I want it all and I deserve it all.
1501261024199987203 2022-03-08 10:18:14 -0800 <vanessaa_mariie> OH MY GOD AND AMAZON BOOKS IS SHUTTING DOWN?!?!?! No I‚Äôm done.
1501260152158113793 2022-03-08 10:14:46 -0800 <TweetacularMatt> @MusicMoviefan27 @FunkoPOPsNews @SkYNYcollects @LazMatt1230 @Jet_LaFever @disney__tasthic Truth. Ah well. At least you had your $5. I don‚Äôt think my Amazon order has shipped yet, so I‚Äôll cancel my common version.
1501259928031408135 2022-03-08 10:13:53 -0800 <doctorow> It is - but only because Amazon predates upon small business owners and drivers, suckering them into arrangements where they pick up the tab for Amazon's critical infrastructure while Amazon skims off the profits. 39/
1501259927117049858 2022-03-08 10:13:53 -0800 <doctorow> Despite the fact that businesses from time immemorial have maintained their own fleets and drivers, Amazon argues that it's literally impossible to operate these crucial business operations on its own. 38/
1501259926152392708 2022-03-08 10:13:53 -0800 <doctorow> These companies took on all of Amazon's delivery risk - "accidents, injuries, van damage and upkeep" - and then cut "owners" loose, sending them into bankruptcy due to long-term leases on vans and parking, workplace injury liabilities, and bills for vans they  had to buy. 37/
1501259924298420236 2022-03-08 10:13:52 -0800 <doctorow> These "entrepreneurs" bore all the risk and expense of delivering our parcels within its ever-shrinking promised delivery windows: Then Amazon rugpulled these "independent companies," terminating its contracts with no notice or explanation. 35/
1501259921773539331 2022-03-08 10:13:52 -0800 <doctorow> Or Amazon, which has vertically integrated a publisher, warehouses audiobooks, house brands, cloud, and videos, but can't *possibly* deliver its parcels and must rely on layers of sub-contractors to do work that is dangerous, precarious, and pays less than minimum wage. 33/
1501259916224471058 2022-03-08 10:13:50 -0800 <doctorow> Some of these calls are easy to make: ban anyone who runs an app- or game-store from making apps or games that are sold in the store and ban Amazon from competing with the businesses that sell in its marketplace. 27/
1501259835664384013 2022-03-08 10:13:31 -0800 <doctorow> Today, vertical mergers and vertical monopolies are the backbone of platform capitalism. Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and others have created "two-sided marketplaces" that connect buyers and sellers, in which they *also participate as buyers and sellers*. 13/
1501259827724627968 2022-03-08 10:13:29 -0800 <doctorow> That's where the debate over tech has arrived at: the idea that we must preserve giants like Facebook and Google and Apple and Amazon to continue to derive the benefits they deliver, and that only the great geniuses at their helms are qualified to lead them. 5/
1501259682865770500 2022-03-08 10:12:55 -0800 <fakeSammyC> I keep seeing ‚ÄúKratos is coming to Amazon‚Äù and then imagining him storming in and shouting ‚ÄúWHERE IS JEFFERY?!? WE HATH BUSINESS TO DISCUSS‚Äù
1501255473135185922 2022-03-08 09:56:11 -0800 <Jykinturah> I like how I check the news and I see: - news about Putin's worthless war still continuing - 64% of American's living paycheck to paycheck - Amazon Rainforest More Fucked Than Expected  I'm having a great morning.

And no commercials (aside from some quick plugs for some Amazon Prime shows, which I was ok with!), and it's friendly to cord-cutters and you don't have to censor anything/worry about getting fined by the FCC, so things can be more colorful!

Why can't we choose our own recording monitoring service?  Why are we forced to use Amazon and its technology services which have proved to be quite corrupt.

1500945092600754176 2022-03-07 13:22:50 -0800 <K1D_rue> Waiting for @UPS to deliver a package is so anxiety inducing. They give you a window and they let you see the delivery trucks location. Ive seen the same driver pass my house like 6x but doesnt stop. At least amazon lets you know that your package is like 6 stops away.

1500920903261057025 2022-03-07 11:46:43 -0800 <darafaye> @BasedLASports When stability is lost, it takes longer to recover from incidents that may be caused by global heating such as wildfires. The Amazon is currently approaching a tipping point and when that is triggered, it‚Äôll be too late and very bad.   The article explains it in simplicity.
1500919917918314497 2022-03-07 11:42:48 -0800 <itsmarkusbraun> If I order anything from Amazon My only condition is that I add a book to every order. Don‚Äôt forget to #stackbooks  üìö while you #stackETHüí∞to keep the brain workin üí™üèº

1500901613527085062 2022-03-07 10:30:04 -0800 <Nicolascole77> 2/ Always be "in beta"  Don't ever think your startup will reach an end.  Don't strive for "done."  Even at 600,000 employees and $1.5 trillion in market cap, Amazon still operates as "it's always Day 1."  Greatness should be a forever journey, not a destination.

I'm not sure Tesla wants to make Amazon delivery trucks, as an example, though. I know he's mentioned vans and know CT and semi. Will they do a $5k sub-sub-compact for a India?

1500568583847374848 2022-03-06 12:26:44 -0800 <Carrie_Jeanne> Why does Amazon feel the need to ship things in boxes that are four times too large?

Not sure if you've mentioned these before - but I'd say Elrond (HT exclusive), Galadriel, and Sauron could all be good candidates. They will all be featured in Amazon's LOTR show, so they're bound to rise in value!
1500227670407143425 2022-03-05 13:52:04 -0800 <DMS721> @ACMawards Will this be on TV or only on Amazon prime?
1500227126624079873 2022-03-05 13:49:54 -0800 <cc_pinstripes> @DunnJeffry No. Lmfao Amazon.
1500224996265713667 2022-03-05 13:41:26 -0800 <TerriKopp2it> @AuntieAyla Yes. The Apica CD notebook (dark blue lower right) with premium paper is awesome. Anything with 68 gsm Tomoe River paper (the enigma and breeze by Taroko Design - available on Etsy), clairefontaine, and Miquelrius (not pictured but on Amazon). No bleeding or feathering.

1500222019618557953 2022-03-05 13:29:36 -0800 <djfluffkins> @m3u8 Mine is slightly more generic. I was at Amazon, then moved to Twitch in 2018.  I came to learn product and was told they wanted to learn from me.  My experience? Amazon‚Äôs structured process helps us move FASTER and more dependably. Twitch wasn‚Äôt that, but still critical of Amazon

1500171601962098688 2022-03-05 10:09:16 -0800 <TomfooleryTM> @GraceRandolph Had to cancel my unlimited subscription. It was an even better engine for finding new comics than browsing shelves at the shoppe. What a bungle by Amazon.
1500162855294758912 2022-03-05 09:34:31 -0800 <Banana3Stocks> @TylerOswald16 @WifeyAlpha Amazon is dirt cheap and so are many stocks. Sentiment and shifts in the market happen quick.

1499885333562855427 2022-03-04 15:11:44 -0800 <fromedome> @JustinSoffer @amazon Guess it depends ‚Äî what service would they want to exclude from regular Prime members? Can‚Äôt be anything that would make Prime less sticky.

1499854194441818112 2022-03-04 13:08:00 -0800 <InevitablyBill> Folks are asking how they can see the new episodes of #TheGhostAndMollyMcGee if they don't have Disney Channel. They are coming to Disney+ soonish, but if you can't wait, you can watch them (for a fee) on Amazon Prime and Apple TV.
1499853764357853185 2022-03-04 13:06:18 -0800 <annawbarber> 3/But competition is fierce. Consumers want everything‚Äîdelivery speed, low prices AND supply chain visibility. Amazon has trained consumers to expect speed and low prices, and consumers translate those expectations even when buying direct from brands outside the Amazon ecosystem.
1499853763443507202 2022-03-04 13:06:17 -0800 <annawbarber> 2/The barriers to entry for new DTC brands are lower than ever today‚Äîwith maturing copacker and 3PL networks, Shopify and Amazon and last-mile delivery networks, new brands can be up and running quickly in a way that wasn‚Äôt possible a decade ago.

1499795818211016706 2022-03-04 09:16:02 -0800 <LaurenEM26> Branding:  Amazon operated 3 types of retail stores.  But customers didn‚Äôt understand the purpose of each location.  AMZN Fresh is succeeding. It‚Äôs a ‚Äúfresh‚Äù take on grocery - skip the dreaded checkout line.   Retailers need to give shoppers a concrete reason to visit IRL
1499795817070149633 2022-03-04 09:16:02 -0800 <LaurenEM26> Location Strategy:   By industry metrics, Amazon did not chose the wrong locations.  But CRE has relied on the same data for decades.   Retailers need to determine the purpose of a physical location and utilize customer data to select locations that fit their ‚Äúwhy‚Äù

1499774796590039044 2022-03-04 07:52:30 -0800 <LASmogGuy> The only rub is this pollution petty cash drawer has been used to benefit massive &amp; lucrative companies (e.g. Amazon, shipping interests). We‚Äôre literally telling these folks they don‚Äôt have to clean up pollution from their projects bc we got this pollution petty cash drawer.

1499585786718523393 2022-03-03 19:21:27 -0800 <jenorton> It‚Äôs interesting that Amazon vans use a scratchy squawk when backing up instead of the classic repeating beep.  Did we grow numb to the classic beep like we grew numb to car alarms? Did we need to be awoken from our urban slumber of tuning out beeping everywhere?

1499577958033346560 2022-03-03 18:50:20 -0800 <janefourmillion> @ConorDTucker I thought Whole Foods just had lockers!  My condo (we homeowners ) just agreed to pay $23,000 to reconfigure part of the garage to put in Amazon lockers.  There are 100 owners, so it‚Äôs not a heavy hit.
1499576206542344192 2022-03-03 18:43:23 -0800 <janefourmillion> @ConorDTucker But do you have to re-wrap it?  At the Amazon stores, you don‚Äôt‚Äî except the product box (like an air fryer).  But you don‚Äôt need to put that box in the carton it was delivered in. You hand them the merch and they scan the thingy on your phone.  Done.

I can hear high frequency well.  that's why the hearing aids I got off Amazon killed my head. It's the low tones, men, older women that I can't hear. I miss entire words.

1499397949033353220 2022-03-03 06:55:03 -0800 <vikbakhru> This is the strategy that Amazon used to transform retail. It‚Äôs the strategy Netflix used to transform entertainment. And it‚Äôs the strategy we all ought to be using to usher in a new era of health care ‚Äî one that‚Äôs seamless, smooth, simple, and service-focused.

1499282205838745601 2022-03-02 23:15:07 -0800 <jennylens> @AmazonHelp SO WHY can't we use our checking account, which is attached to our debit card? NOT our fault when someone hacks us or we lose our debit card. I spent MORE time dealing with Amazon than changing ALL my online billing settings for utilities, memberships, etc.
1499281581797568513 2022-03-02 23:12:39 -0800 <jennylens> @AmazonHelp I KNOW CHECKING ACCOUNTS cannot be used for subscriptions now. BUT what happens when someone is hacked or loses their debit card? So they LOSE their Prime too??? How is that fair? NOT my fault someone hacked my debit card, but Amazon PUNISHING ME.
1499281240985243653 2022-03-02 23:11:17 -0800 <EllyClutch> @spicymarii ??!?!? Do you have an Amazon wishlist?!
1499279602924982274 2022-03-02 23:04:47 -0800 <jennylens> @AmazonHelp PS Since when do banks give out temporary card numbers? Get real. MUCH easier for Amazon to realize that hackers are increasing their grifts. WHY won't Amazon let us use our checking account for subs, esp when checking connected to debit cards???
1499279254948773890 2022-03-02 23:03:24 -0800 <jennylens> @AmazonHelp NO AMAZON CAN ALLOW US TO USE OUR CHECKING ACCOUNT. WHY must YOU bend the world to suit you? After I spent MORE than an hour BEING LIED to and insulted? Now you want ME to do more work? NO way to treat a long time Amazon + Prime customer!
1499279044684124162 2022-03-02 23:02:34 -0800 <Callmenicholi> @seanmcginnis @amazon @Google A cease and desist letter should do it but if it‚Äôs trademarked then more leverage of course.  Amazon does this a lot and have been for a long time.

1499263117955518464 2022-03-02 21:59:16 -0800 <CarrieCraftgeek> @Thexscha They also want to have it both ways. In the podcast they say knitting is a perfect ‚Äúnitch‚Äù b/c there‚Äôs relatively low competition on Amazon. And we‚Äôre explaining part of the reason why. But, we‚Äôre wrong because so much knitting stuff is sold in Amazon.

1499233902862372868 2022-03-02 20:03:11 -0800 <jennylens> @amazon no one has defended you longer nor more vocally than I. I am so grateful. But when you allow stupid policies to punish people whose debit cards are hacked + won't connect to checking accounts + your employees lie + waste our time, shame on you. We have better things to do
1499233561580228608 2022-03-02 20:01:50 -0800 <jennylens> I can't stop crying about #Ukraine. I know I am blessed. But when we depend upon #AmazonPrime + they lie + waste our time, then it's time to call them out for the sometimes reprehensible policies + heartless, lying employees who ruin their rep + needlessly stress us. @amazon
1499231900304502786 2022-03-02 19:55:14 -0800 <jennylens> @amazon at a time when tensions are high, we all need to be attentive to each other + compassionate. I WAS LIED to on phone.

1499165351145140227 2022-03-02 15:30:47 -0800 <CarrieCraftgeek> @disaster_march That was an odd comment. The issue isn‚Äôt that a product is from China. Chiagoo are very popular. It‚Äôs that what you tend to find on Amazon is not great quality. Or there‚Äôs risk if counterfeits. And how were those two guys going to sell anything different from what‚Äôs there?

It‚Äôs aimed at their current and potential e*omcrew premium members. They had a year of content they were planning to sell to wannabe Amazon sellers and that‚Äôs what they want to save, IMHO

1499124255681695745 2022-03-02 12:47:29 -0800 <BenKayWriter> @therichardsilk So it doesn't remind you what the company does. It just reminds you of the company it represents. And this repeat exposure thing is what means you can produce a logo as crappy as Amazon's and have it not matter, which was my original point.

1499093761686523905 2022-03-02 10:46:19 -0800 <TeeVeeBen> Like, if they can make the same profit on price surging three screens for Batman instead of flat-rating six screens?  Maybe they can take those other screens make a real case for more Netflix / Amazon / HBO original limited engagements. Maybe it opens the door for rom coms.

I took the liberty of reframing "next Google" as a "potential to reach $1T market cap" and obviously thought of co's trying to become the next-gen Amazon.  I agree w/ you that nothing comes close to "next Google" in the sense you're referring to.
1499072989995884550 2022-03-02 09:23:46 -0800 <lasagna_silent> @tehlike @katgleason Maybe DoorDash or GoPuff have the potential to become Amazon-scale? Or rather, their equivalents in the developing world (10x cheaper labor and real estate for fulfillment centers).

If you do, make sure your parents will be ok with you accepting gifts!

1498861355088023559 2022-03-01 19:22:49 -0800 <DavidColeStein> @sabremikecarrol I appreciate that, Mike. Thank you. The big problem is, self-publishing is tricky when you're banned from Amazon. I'd be putting a lot of money in, with an uphill climb of getting it back. I'm still seeking a new publisher, because I need someone with "reach" so I can break even.
1498859504758263809 2022-03-01 19:15:28 -0800 <AD90249> @amazon been waiting on a replacement for my defective #EchoShow 15 for 2 months and an agent tells me it‚Äôs delayed because it‚Äôs out of stock. If I buy new, I can get it tomorrow. What‚Äôs up with that?

But I don‚Äôt think taking lurker benefits from streamers but still gaining ad revenue from lurkers is too far fetched for Amazon/twitch. At any rate. Lurking is always welcome support
1498837641785139200 2022-03-01 17:48:35 -0800 <MichaelKenKen> Good news: after being available only by purchase for months, those without HBO Max can finally rent #FREAKY on iTunes, Amazon, Google Play, YouTube etc. Rent and enjoy! It also makes a great double feature with #ScreamMovie or #HappyDeathDay!!
1498837219615776771 2022-03-01 17:46:54 -0800 <Postbro1> @DebbieSVA @kayleighmcenany Nah. All the shutdowns did that. Amazon, Walmart, etc all kept on clicking while small businesses across the nation were forced to shutdown completely or reduce capacity &amp; follow rules to the point they couldn't generate enough revenue to survive.

1498800580558417921 2022-03-01 15:21:19 -0800 <RonenBenReuben> @nastyriff @BernieSanders In the United States, Amazon, Microsoft, Tesla, and Apple were all built by individuals from scratch. In Russia, these oligarchs illegally/unethically acquired public industries that were built and owned by the people (soviets). Plus, none of them are president of the country.
1498797520293543936 2022-03-01 15:09:09 -0800 <getvent> TAG started in the 50's- the groundwork was there, but canada has to start a union in the same era as Amazon posting anti-union flyers in bathrooms.  BUT it's not impossible. 2021/2022 has been monumental for union strength. TAG has recognized and included canadian studios. (2/3)
1498795546705727488 2022-03-01 15:01:19 -0800 <itsmadqueen> @Soap_m8 @Twitch Doesn‚Äôt at all. But honestly just because they take away the view count from the streamer doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt getting ad money for the lurkers. Get money with out giving back makes perfect sense for Amazon imo

1498777483516133380 2022-03-01 13:49:32 -0800 <heybrucewright> It's not a shady thing. Nothing to join.  Just watch his videos and follow along and you will get your ps5 at RETAIL price from Target, Walmart, Best Buy, Gamestop or Amazon.  He knows about the drops ahead of time, and prepares you to buy in split-seconds.
1498776382477905925 2022-03-01 13:45:10 -0800 <AdamComedian> My wife loves to play this game called ‚ÄúGuess why I‚Äôm mad at you?‚Äù It starts when she only cooks for herself. Round 2 is when she gets a bunch of Amazon Boxes delivered.

1498770748982263809 2022-03-01 13:22:47 -0800 <BelenkyDavid> @HarveyFierstein Amazon apologized, but ‚Äòdue to high demand,‚Äô my copy is running late. That‚Äôs better than a great review!!!!
1498763893107134464 2022-03-01 12:55:32 -0800 <BridgetPhetasy> @wil_da_beast630 @justjeren which tech nation were we going to live in again? Was it Amazon or Apple? I can't remember.
1498763845665390592 2022-03-01 12:55:21 -0800 <backinblack_la> ESPN and Fox currently hold English-language rights in the country for US men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs national team games, but CBS Sports, Turner Sports, and Amazon were reportedly all in the mix to partner with US Soccer for the next cycle.
1498763632527634435 2022-03-01 12:54:30 -0800 <johnlanzajr> Ever forgotten what was in an Amazon package you ordered the day before? This may be a warning sign you're looking more for the rush than the item.

1498756652912107520 2022-03-01 12:26:46 -0800 <jjschoch> @rja77732 We can write Amazon reviews for each other.
1498755730328805382 2022-03-01 12:23:06 -0800 <Synergy3k> Bad idea to buy refurbished MacBook Pro?I love the 2019 I have for work, I‚Äôm not crazy about the newer generation ones without the Intel chip. Worth it to buy older one from something like Amazon Renewed? I had a 2012 that lasted until 2020. üòÇ
1498755602801070081 2022-03-01 12:22:35 -0800 <GComixxx> @FilmSchoolRooki @BoundingComics I do,the character has always been depicted as white for nearly 20 years,to now change his for diversity and woke points is the exact same reason Tolkien fans are trashing Amazon
1498754542841647104 2022-03-01 12:18:23 -0800 <kaydachina> I wish Amazon was local like a Target

1498747753622474753 2022-03-01 11:51:24 -0800 <lolitsjaceee> Does anyone else add like $500 worth of shit to their Amazon cart even though we know we won‚Äôt hit purchase because we can‚Äôt afford it but we do it just for the serotonin of online shopping? Or is that just me? üòÇ
1498743662259236865 2022-03-01 11:35:09 -0800 <_jenmay> @AkilahObviously Theorie body washes smell amazing- I love the bamboo one- a little pricey but nicely sized bottle that lasts a while (can find on Amazon)

1498736312026685446 2022-03-01 11:05:56 -0800 <mell_13> I just had to WATCH a YOUTUBE VIDEO to find out how to chat with a @amazon COSTUMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE. ü§°  I wonder how many people go like "whoah, I love the automated system, I have 300 hours of my day to listen to 878 options to solve a 2min problem ‚ò†Ô∏è"
1498735862623866880 2022-03-01 11:04:09 -0800 <ApostolicBible1> @ClaytonJKillion There is plenty of proof, but most people have not looked at the actual evidence. The evidence is presented in the book ‚ÄúThe Original Matthew 28:19 Restored‚Äù sold in Amazon

1498724680634568705 2022-03-01 10:19:43 -0800 <peterpham> Amazon should buy @Peloton, it's another screen, another alexa device in a room, another subscription like @ring @geteero, another smart device and another great team. Peloton is sitting at $9B market cap.

1498721998708482052 2022-03-01 10:09:04 -0800 <mdotacevedo> I'm pretty sure the amazon drop ship ads I get on youtube are produced by youtube to make me pay for premium. I am just trying to learn here! I am not here for some get rich quick scheme!
1498720781584322569 2022-03-01 10:04:13 -0800 <yuusharo> @azeriafx @marcoarment Yup, there is so much power of inertia behind the default app stores that not even giants like Amazon or Epic can convince a significant enough people to jump off them. Mobile market is just too big.  Sideloading helps niche apps exist while the App Store can be more curated.
