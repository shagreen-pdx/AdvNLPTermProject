Anyone slamming Peloton and in the last 2 months has no idea how hard it is to build a hardware start up
Olivia Amato is the reason I m addicted to my Peloton
I still haven t done a 60 minute Done a few 45 minute ones tho
I m down to join any weekday morning 730a central or earlier
bro that party was so sick when you came out to chicago cant believe it went until 6 am good times
It s weird that his is so far off
I had stock My girlfriend was out of fruit and she was still working So I picked up a few things for her and delivered them Peloton now I m behind on tallboyfriday
That makes sense The talent is the moat that all these services have That s why I think it s stupid when people predict doom for Peloton I m such a huge fan of Jess Sims and some of the other instructors it would take something 100x worse than Joe Rogan to make me quit
I was doing so well with this peloton and now haven t used the shit since January New day and all that though
I was talking about this last week I went CRAZY last year Between moving buying a peloton going on vacation and buying hella clothes I spent waaaayyyy too much and I didn t even stop to reflect until November of last year
Yesss too long
At least you got your workout in Cuz That s what matters
At one time not long ago Peloton had a market cap of 50 billion with only 6 6 million active customers That s 7 500 a customer Crazy It s now around 12 billion They re are also scrapping a 400 million facility that was being constructed in Ohio
Probably did the worst back and bicep workout maybe peloton or stairmaster later to make up for it
No no no EBC does not have a spike in usage as their membership base maintains healthy habits throughout the course of the year
Jan 1st I m hittin that steam room hard
Very sad 30 minute just ride on the Peloton tonight Trying to get back in shape after I took an ill advised 2 month hiatus in solidarity w the Accident Boy But the first one is usually the hardest and at least I worked up a tiny sweat Better tomorrow I hope
He s still here But I m not ready to talk about it Baby steps
Yea I m strangely only venting on here because no one is on twitter And going through it the first month or two was hard enough talking about it to people who knew Didn t want it on social media Didn t want attention
Long term goals
Anyone else afraid to get on their peloton in the morning AndJustLikeThat
idk why mr big having a peloton is making me lose my shit but it is
I really wish Instagram let me categorize my follows especially for stories I don t necessarily need all the Peloton instructors my actual friends and random dog accounts all jumbled into one big string out
These little ass peloton weights sneak up on you
It s 9 40 it s cold Should I try to workout Peloton
Anything and all Newbie here and I m officially obsessed thanks to him
