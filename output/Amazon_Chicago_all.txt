1501357938778116096 2022-03-08 16:43:21 -0800 <wendimyb> @gyaigyimii I was so excited about No Remorse on Amazon Prime but they did that movie half ass.   Jordan needs another movie.
1501357251495444483 2022-03-08 16:40:37 -0800 <Btamayo_BLT> I moved back home a few days ago for financial reasons and my mother has already started her comments about the black communities in the south and west of Chicago and me finding a job. "Amazon pays well if you have a master's."   Thank you, Maria, for your two cents.
1501349012783263746 2022-03-08 16:07:53 -0800 <svdbvby_> I completely forgot I got a $20 Amazon gift card from my job yesterday, but I don‚Äôt even shop on Amazon ü•≤
1501345130061643780 2022-03-08 15:52:27 -0800 <nsrunner1> @ColleenAnderso2 @cnnbrk That‚Äôs a logistics issue not a daily delivery issue. Ask Amazon how to solve that. Trump‚Äôs guy only made it worse. Get the right people to bring the business model out of the 1970‚Äôs.
1501343519327371266 2022-03-08 15:46:03 -0800 <BluthCapital> @adequateryan Maybe waiting for down 90% from peak just like Amazon.
1501343121359224839 2022-03-08 15:44:28 -0800 <BluthCapital> @ivan_labrie I made no trades on it. And it tripled thereafter! But math comes home to roost. The idea was even if it really could be the next Amazon you were paying 1999 prices for it which is folly.

1501272440131006467 2022-03-08 11:03:36 -0800 <rndmdeinonychus> Something very funny about Amazon apologizing to me for there being a delay in the Blu-ray of THE MONSTER FROM GREEN HELL shipping out to me.  Like I feel like I should actually be thanking them for looking out for me, or something.

1501229907527061506 2022-03-08 08:14:36 -0800 <michaelsobrien> New trend of people sending me nasty emails for not getting games that start after 8 p.m. into the print newspaper.   Someone has to write it, edit it, print an actual paper and drive it to your house! It isn't sitting in an Amazon warehouse somewhere waiting to be delivered.
1501226726264766468 2022-03-08 08:01:57 -0800 <Fit_Marguerite> @shiba_shan So I looked into the sizes of them and the small appears to be too big for me. They don‚Äôt come in extra small on Amazon (that I know of) I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô4 so even though my stomach is where I hold the most I have trouble finding brands that actually fit me
1501224968235143168 2022-03-08 07:54:58 -0800 <slucy> @jmd5120 Ok but one Amazon van delivering packages to 100+ households for 12 hours a day is very different than 100+ households storing an SUV 23 hours a day and then all driving to a surface parking lot at a big box store to pick up a phone charger or whatever.

1501217764266098689 2022-03-08 07:26:20 -0800 <jmd5120> Yes many deliveries are made by bike, but many are not! The Amazon deliveries are certainly not by bike.
1501210439870562312 2022-03-08 06:57:14 -0800 <Wolots3> Leftists will tell you about the corrupting influence of big business. They also fail to point out that mainstream media is actually just a bunch of big businesses just like Shell and Amazon
1501208913361911817 2022-03-08 06:51:10 -0800 <soxmachine_josh> @mikeD399 That they do, however, MLB has already sold those TV rights for the next 4-5 seasons. Only package not included is a pending deal with Amazon or Apple

1501030660139536384 2022-03-07 19:02:51 -0800 <Bababooey_Boo> @lolotuda I highly recommend it. It‚Äôs great. It‚Äôs on Amazon Prime if you have it.
1501030084446199809 2022-03-07 19:00:34 -0800 <caravaggiorob> I never hit "No Thanks" faster than when Amazon goes "Would you like to share this shopping list with any of your friends?" What? Fuck no. U nuts?
1501029158687850500 2022-03-07 18:56:53 -0800 <lgerard> @shylobisnett Update: I bought a kit on amazon. Wish me luck.
1501023513767030789 2022-03-07 18:34:28 -0800 <brookebreit> someone sent my child a 5 pack of cheap sunglasses from amazon, no idea who sent it  a week later, another 5 pack of sunglasses arrived  the only explanation is some mystery person has accidentally subscribed my child to repeated weekly shipments of COOL SUMMER

1500955769776320523 2022-03-07 14:05:16 -0800 <torqpenderloin> the amazon fresh ad that plays on youtube tv which is just a child vlogger (??) with zero voiceover experience talking about how amazing grocery shopping can be is deeply unsettling

I‚Äôm predicting those games will be on another network either CBS/CBS Sports/Amazon Prime/Facebook/Twitter or something else new. Can only wait and see; can only assume something else in is store
1500922311687483392 2022-03-07 11:52:19 -0800 <catchmeplease1> @houseofcarlyle Because there are kids in Ukraine that don‚Äôt even have a bowl to puke on and you are considering throwing away a perfectly good one, that nicely sterilizes, when you load it in the dishwasher. Also, because typing ‚Äúbowl‚Äùand clicking ‚Äúbuy now‚Äù on the Amazon app is a chore.

1500920251231481858 2022-03-07 11:44:08 -0800 <BradEbann> @BoiledSports I could see Benitti doing NBA or NFL fulltime.  There‚Äôs huge money getting thrown around by Amazon and there will a bidding war soon.  Also could see Hummel being on a top team soon and no longer calling BTN games.  I know he calls games for ESPN but he‚Äôs not on the top team yet
1500919728772108289 2022-03-07 11:42:03 -0800 <ChiScoundrel> @quinneverett I don't think so, the Deep Sea definitely looks great but the Amazon Gray does too so I don't see a big loss.

1500911176024485888 2022-03-07 11:08:04 -0800 <DeniseJones_32> I don‚Äôt understand why Amazon deliver drivers feel like it‚Äôs okay to throw your packages on the porch.

I personally feel like DoorDash, Uber, and Amazon have enslaved the impoverished by underpaying them for their labor and time.   I guess we will wait 20 years to notice as always

1500626935709413386 2022-03-06 16:18:36 -0800 <VictoriaNoire_> Amazon would be top tier if they accepted PayPal credit.

1500605792554262535 2022-03-06 14:54:35 -0800 <blt_no_bacon> @wrighteousj @Kovalo @streamlabs One thing I learned is to never trust the manufacturer software to work correctly. Id consider using a capture card from elgato or one from Amazon.   Prob not the best to hear "buy more stuff" but if your still having  problems with a cap card atleast you know the cam is faulty.
1500599834662813703 2022-03-06 14:30:55 -0800 <EclecticStraws> I just ordered house essentials off Amazon and I‚Äôm proud of myself by making my life easier
1500597710772129797 2022-03-06 14:22:28 -0800 <TraceyRyniec> @matthayes55 They are growing GMV. There is a lot of competition. Doubtful anyone is leaving 1stDibs to go to Amazon, though. Somewhere else? Sure. RH will soon have an antiques division. Maybe there.
1500591409413464066 2022-03-06 13:57:26 -0800 <rileydonald7> I‚Äôve scrolled for a movie on Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, HBO, you name it for the last 20-30 minutes. Absolutely nothing of interest. Not even one sounded slightly intriguing. Do movies just stink nowadays?
1500586300713451522 2022-03-06 13:37:08 -0800 <Beautyand_aBabe> amazon dropped off my package with it tore open completely and my bag is EMPTY. where‚Äôs my shit??
1500580690236162051 2022-03-06 13:14:50 -0800 <JoeMart98640240> @TheWrongWarp Majority had easy accessibility to their findings. If one "was not meant to know" then I shouldn't be able to find a book on NWO as "bEst seLLeR" on Amazon.   Predictions were always wrong. There was always a SIDE to choose. FEMAFEMAFEMAFEMA. History is fake, trump real tho.

1500568111514275851 2022-03-06 12:24:51 -0800 <brianportnoy> I wish there were a much nicer way to gift e-books. While people love signed hard copies, many still prefer an e-book to read and to avoid clutter.  Anyone find a more-elegant solution than just the standard Amazon protocol?
1500567175219798026 2022-03-06 12:21:08 -0800 <diaryofnoire> @coldestwinters I got mine from Amazon and I love them. Super comfy
1500567149944913921 2022-03-06 12:21:02 -0800 <brittanytiara_> Amazon is winning because I can order something today and get it today. üò≠

1500562843036495872 2022-03-06 12:03:55 -0800 <ShamontielV> @_S_choir It's definitely not always free. For example, you have to subscribe to Amazon Prime to get Whole Foods to do it. Target won't pick out a BUNCH of groceries (not even bread) for pickup. By the time you pick and choose, you may as well go in the store.

1500534987032084486 2022-03-06 10:13:14 -0800 <itsahazardlife> @kuyamanzano Honestly..... Amazon's KDP is a good option for this. Would come sort of like a paperback covered book. So it's not a traditional magazine, but would give you the option to offer both digital and physical copies.

1500512957607858176 2022-03-06 08:45:41 -0800 <SexPosHealth> @OregonBravesMan @DrEricDing @CDCDirector I feel this. Even with masking rules in place, I haven‚Äôt felt safe to venture anywhere indoors w/ her except to medical appointments (which is how she got COVID this winter.) We use @Instacart and @amazon for almost everything. Work is our only risk (and it‚Äôs a big one as HCWs).
1500512552958185478 2022-03-06 08:44:05 -0800 <DarkMimiTV> Not even mentioning the 180 day wait to add another person on if you remove someone from the household, yikes.  I need Miirya to put Amazon out of business in the near future, tysm.
1500512551821578241 2022-03-06 08:44:05 -0800 <DarkMimiTV> Amazon Household is a pain in the butt. I was going to add someone onto the account but you can only have TWO adults?   This is a silly restriction considering that your household could consist of much more than just a partner and kids :/
1500508825656385537 2022-03-06 08:29:16 -0800 <BadNano_9MM> @JackCarrUSA Dude your writing style is both kinetic &amp; a enjoyable read. Looking forward to your next book! And congrats on the new Amazon tv series!!! üëçüëçüëç
1500498383278120961 2022-03-06 07:47:47 -0800 <BrandonGates5> Selling any of the following items on amazon to me is unwise   Glass  Clothes  Breakables   Can you make money? Yes  Will your returns be through the roof? Also, BIG FAT YES
1500496978781917190 2022-03-06 07:42:12 -0800 <Girlszzx> time to wrap myself in a blanket burrito and shop on amazon all day
1500489515387047941 2022-03-06 07:12:32 -0800 <EvanLaRuffa> @autozone still sucks. Buy parts on Amazon or through your mechanic.
1500475060653637639 2022-03-06 06:15:06 -0800 <AlyceBarry> @KimIversenShow How much did you spend on sh*t from Amazon last week?
1500456425260204041 2022-03-06 05:01:03 -0800 <EducRadiElevATE> When you shop, a percentage of the purchase is donated to our organization at NO COST to you. You shop, #Amazon gives!   Bookmark #AmazonSmile so you don‚Äôt forget!  Collectively, these small donations can make a big impact!
1500444338542850050 2022-03-06 04:13:01 -0800 <Ballsin2> @StephenKing and Amazon treats its employees like garbage, will you boycott Amazon? lol
1500435801137627137 2022-03-06 03:39:06 -0800 <ClementineOfNA> @plagueisland told you not to get the amazon job
1500433038743908354 2022-03-06 03:28:07 -0800 <drmariajestrada> @KupcakeProse Same. There is some theme or line that is central to the novel. However, I have learned to then look up said title on Amazon. I was set on The Harvest, until I found someone else wrote a dystopian series on exactly the same titles I had in mind, so now it's The Harvested. sigh.
1500405517600137217 2022-03-06 01:38:46 -0800 <tara_oshea> also I am now looking for vintage travel posters to replace the posters that I had in the frames before and I just came across an Amazon listing for the painting of Vigo the Carpathian. there are multiple different listings, none of which mentioned Ghostbusters 2.   is this hell?

1500317626144378886 2022-03-05 19:49:31 -0800 <StacyAlbano> @rayferrarotsn I never leave home without packing a power bank. Luckily, Amazon has Duracell Power Banks that can charge your phone in a jiffy. Their $50 10100mAh power bank can charge your phone up to 6x in one use.
1500312954364907522 2022-03-05 19:30:57 -0800 <JAMBRIZ20> I keep getting calls from @amazon, repeatedly, all day, from random numbers saying there‚Äôs a $900 pending order w/ a iPhone 13 &amp; to authorize it. It‚Äôs 930pmCST &amp; STILL CALLING!! Make it stop!üò≠üò©#Scammers #amazon

1500301270602719232 2022-03-05 18:44:31 -0800 <JustinStarren> @angiefagerlin Maybe the NIH needs to start paying a living wage for reviewing.  It typically pays less that working in an Amazon warehouse.  Are we surprised that quality is suffering?
1500296829300269056 2022-03-05 18:26:52 -0800 <tara_oshea> Why is it that the Amazon guy never rings the bell when it's my packages but the Amazon guy always ring the bell when it's my neighbour's packages?
1500296153828581386 2022-03-05 18:24:11 -0800 <BrandonGates5> Finding hidden gems yourself on Amazon is a beautiful thing   There‚Äôs nothing I enjoy more than working on other projects and having my VA find an absolute gem üíé   Sometimes you have to trade a $1 to make $2 üéØüéØüéØ

After a previous one wore out, I bought this green one that I‚Äôm wearing now.

1500249287036395522 2022-03-05 15:17:57 -0800 <NotTodayLuv> @FoxNews Imagine getting bombed because you're delivering Pampers.  They need a fleet of Amazon delivery drones coming out of Poland. Bezos could put his money to good use now that he's taken his joy ride in space.

1499979326867050497 2022-03-04 21:25:14 -0800 <tara_oshea> more trial and error ensued for several hours.

1499865635194560513 2022-03-04 13:53:28 -0800 <realDillonEvans> @CrusoniaC FB will show a loss in ad revenue and users next quarter. Amazon is still expensive, just less expensive. I love it when bulls tell me TINA. Bulls have been saying this since September and yet their stocks are down big! I agree, FFR will never go above 2%.

Earnings may not be so strong, at least not strong enough to support the sky high valuations. Think back to Q4 of 2018 when these companies began to miss earnings. Amazon fell 40% in a month. More pain is coming.
1499862250689024010 2022-03-04 13:40:01 -0800 <cantankerous_r> @Ephsmom @maureenjohnson You can find valerian on Amazon, Whole Foods or a local healthfood store.

Amazon and Waldenbooks had a similar restricted selection of books, but the selection included SOME books of merit, where the crappy mall Waldenbooks were all pop chart driven and mostly drivel.

1499493539176087552 2022-03-03 13:14:53 -0800 <TheSkyShowCHI> @robocoko Maybe it becomes a special game for a Facebook watch or amazon prime broadcast? ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü•¥

Lack of diversity in key positions. The D&amp;I lead dipping after 6 months. The disconnect between Twitch and Amazon. Emphasis on advertising instead of using their best asset: streamers

1499385510724354055 2022-03-03 06:05:37 -0800 <mollyfleck> @ChiBuildings Irony is the Amazon bookstore going out of business.

1499370369483882503 2022-03-03 05:05:27 -0800 <godesteHQ> The Stock Market is just a market!  Instead of buying corn, you buy companies.   Instead of going to a traditional in-person market, you go to an online market, kinda like Amazon.   You can filter for the items you want in much the same way. #GodesteInvestingChat
1499370293080604682 2022-03-03 05:05:09 -0800 <WgbChristine> This is after news broke yesterday that Amazon is closing most of its (non-Fresh) physical stores and will focus on #grocery in brick-and-mortar.

The fact that it does is just an indicator of how customers are shopping.

Not selling them everywhere.   Militaries also have tanks, grenades, and surface to air misses, should we make those legal for civilians too?   Hell, why not just allow people to buy nukes off amazon
1499210187244249089 2022-03-02 18:28:57 -0800 <BrynDonovan> Hey, I've got a question.  Which online retailer gives indie authors the biggest royalty?

1499209126471208960 2022-03-02 18:24:44 -0800 <WishTender> @Takaichibi @MasterSadist4 @DashBarkHuss D. Finally, we're better than amazon because we give you the flexibility to decide what to do with the gift funds. You can place the order for the item, or keep the cash, that's up to you.
1499208985123119107 2022-03-02 18:24:10 -0800 <WishTender> @Takaichibi @MasterSadist4 @DashBarkHuss C Continued: Also, if the item is not from an amazon vendor, the gift purchaser can call up the vendor, verify the credit card info that was used, and then ask where the order is going. This has worked to obtain private/sensitive info through amazon.
1499208594373365766 2022-03-02 18:22:37 -0800 <WishTender> @Takaichibi @MasterSadist4 @DashBarkHuss C. We are more secure than amazon. A savvy purchaser can get all sorts of info from amazon because they are the ones who placed the order. They can see your city info, which may not be a big deal, but to some people it is...
1499208315628408835 2022-03-02 18:21:31 -0800 <WishTender> @Takaichibi @MasterSadist4 @DashBarkHuss B. We don't allow refunds. That way we help avoid scams. Whereas, through amazon a fan of yours might purchase a gift only to cancel the gift item shortly after. Not on WishTender.
1499207797266857986 2022-03-02 18:19:27 -0800 <WishTender> @Takaichibi @MasterSadist4 @DashBarkHuss 4. As for amazon, there are lots of reasons why we are better!  A. You can add items to your wishlist from ANY website, or offline items, like your rent, internet bill, or coffee. Artisan, local, high end, all can be done with WishTender.

1499193266637524994 2022-03-02 17:21:43 -0800 <retailgeek> @digitallynativ @laurenthomas @DelRey It‚Äôs funny‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúShowrooming‚Äù used to mean an online retailer (Amazon) turning a Brick and Mortar retailer (Best Buy) into a showroom. Amazon even owned a mobile app for scanning store prices (called Red Laser) and paid customers a $5 bounty to use it in Best Buy.

1499162915630366721 2022-03-02 15:21:06 -0800 <Lexobang> Amazon is about to p me off!
1499159673014046726 2022-03-02 15:08:13 -0800 <TraceyRyniec> There are lots of marketplaces competing now. Amazon is the largest. Etsy now has its own distinctive brand. I like what 1stDibs is doing. And Farfetch has cornered the luxury marketplace in many countries. $AMZN has never taken out any of these competitors. $DIBS $ETSY $FTCH
1499158728104419336 2022-03-02 15:04:28 -0800 <TraceyRyniec> @amazonholder1 @verge Amazon is a horrible retailer. Like I said, they are a good marketplace. I'm glad they finally figured out counterfeits and the like. But they have failed at plenty on the marketplace too. But when you're so big, no one cares about the failures. And AWS masks it all.
1499158107964035074 2022-03-02 15:02:00 -0800 <CurvyDivaLady> For the umpteenth year in a row I‚Äôve asked my daughter what she wanted for her Birthday? She still doesn‚Äôt know.

1499157008775323652 2022-03-02 14:57:38 -0800 <BonesMoses> How do Amazon customers that want to use DMS for an existing on-site server deal with the fact that AWS must have a direct path to the server to work? That just seems non-tenable to me. Most data migration tools are *push* based for exactly this reason.
1499156748044836869 2022-03-02 14:56:36 -0800 <TraceyRyniec> @amazonholder1 Yep, we do. It's why Amazon is opening new brick and mortar stores for its fashion segment, even when failing in books and 4 star. It cannot compete in clothing without it. Selling millions in socks and underwear doesn't make you an industry leader, or much money.
1499155976687132681 2022-03-02 14:53:32 -0800 <TraceyRyniec> @RaviDas90922857 @amazonholder1 @verge Why go to a bookstore? Because they are AMAZING. Computer algorithm on Amazon won't show you the books you really want. Shopping is about discovery. Finding a new item, or book. It's emotional.
1499153549296648199 2022-03-02 14:43:53 -0800 <TraceyRyniec> @amazonholder1 @verge Antitrust has no issue with Amazon in retail. They have no dominance there. In the Marketplace, they DO have dominance. Two different businesses. They fail at some things in Marketplace too though. Amazon Handmade? Failure. Shut it down. Amazon luxury? Won't make it either.
1499153215245455364 2022-03-02 14:42:34 -0800 <AmirNoir> @WR4NYGov @LucidMotors This statement is reasonable for a company that is in their growth statement. Refer to historical financial statements of Amazon and Tesla for example.
1499152813779296261 2022-03-02 14:40:58 -0800 <TraceyRyniec> @amazonholder1 @verge No. Bookstores are quite successful actually. When Amazon opened their brick and mortars, local indies thought they were doomed. Turned out, just the opposite. I've said many times: Amazon hasn't taken out any competitor since Circuit City over a decade ago.
1499152116748890116 2022-03-02 14:38:12 -0800 <lexumana> i need amazon to hurry up w my packages
1499151911978782732 2022-03-02 14:37:23 -0800 <TraceyRyniec> @amazonholder1 @verge Additionally, the bookstores weren't a fun place to shop because you had to have the Amazon app on your phone and scan it in to get the lower "prime" rate. It was just really inconvenient. Again, it's not about the tech. Have to feel something while shopping.
1499151580842672136 2022-03-02 14:36:04 -0800 <TraceyRyniec> @amazonholder1 @verge Brick and mortar is about the experience. Amazon doesn't get it. In its bookstores, it even shut the coffee shops inside, probably because they couldn't compete with Starbucks. But Foxtrot has managed to do so. It's not about the computer algorithm.
1499151192768892928 2022-03-02 14:34:31 -0800 <TraceyRyniec> @amazonholder1 @verge They tried the 4 star concept with the bookstores. It originally carried items that were the highest stars, in addition to the most popular books. Both ideas failed. No one wanted to go to either store because no one cares about Amazon 4 star products in that way. Lol.

1498906665646710786 2022-03-01 22:22:52 -0800 <quittenden71> It took 200 years for the US to reach 1 trillion in debt. That included two world wars/the New Deal/interstate highways/the Cold War/hell... we even went to the moon. Since then we added 30 trillion. For what? Well, we f@cked up the Middle East, &amp; gave tax breaks to Amazon! #SOTU

They have to fight for shifts and if they don‚Äôt get them fast enough via the app, poof, the shift is taken by someone else. This is not a way to run a trillion dollar business.

You can simply download and this is the base file before venturing on the Amazon or any website format. Nothing to be scared of. Trust me. I'm into technology.

1498513804543639555 2022-02-28 20:21:46 -0800 <Trex_lee> My product made it to Amazon buy box and sold out in 2 hours. I should‚Äôve bought more üò≠
1498505402719289345 2022-02-28 19:48:23 -0800 <abbaskins> @hannaemilyy Yep, it‚Äôs a tossup, app has been that way for years. nothing else to do unfortunately.   The Apple TV, Amazon box, Roku box should work better.   Or ‚Äî you can hook up a laptop.   Annoying, yes.

1498475800600928261 2022-02-28 17:50:45 -0800 <badftbolfans> @drvolts Do you know what % of automobile registrations are EVs? You don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs less than 2% so it‚Äôs pretty ridiculous to think the USPS was in any better position than let‚Äôs say Amazon to already have a fleet of EVs in service. Bloomberg is a bad source, strictly pandering to lefties.

1498470571490881542 2022-02-28 17:29:59 -0800 <ChrisPrunotto> More than anything, the thing I hate about Amazon is how it's become a nonsensical fucking flea market. Just thousands upon thousands of fake vendors selling fake knockoff products.
1498470414426820608 2022-02-28 17:29:21 -0800 <clown_clout_> @synanthropy @deepdishpussy good luck i hope u get the negs back!! This is my first time doing 35mm photography actually. I got one roll each of color and b&amp;w both on amazon cuz i had a gift card. next time i'll prob buy from b&amp;h online or central camera in person
1498469126695759872 2022-02-28 17:24:14 -0800 <talyourpal> I have this fun habit of ordering things on Amazon, immediately forgetting I ordered them, and being pleasantly surprised when a package shows up two days later.
1498467388534177799 2022-02-28 17:17:20 -0800 <DanJoshuaRubin> $TDOC deal w $AMZN - Bet Amazon extracts 100x the value from the data - zip codes, type of person uses it, etc. Then will use data to jack those customers. And sell em discount Anusol and whatnot. TDOC here is a turtle taking a flight with a vulture.

1498427454783959049 2022-02-28 14:38:39 -0800 <abrekke83> @fadylace @official_throne From what I've experienced, yes! I was part of a different service a few years ago, and it was nowhere near this professional, and only allowed Amazon.   There's a lot of transparency about pricing, and they offer tracking, which is a huge plus over the other platform.
1498420950789931013 2022-02-28 14:12:48 -0800 <gerasimenkoju> You do not have to purchase the supplies through Amazon, could use another site that will deliver to them quickly or buy at a store and deliver yourself to location above during hours posted on their website. When I called them, they said they will be there late tonight/tomorrow.
1498420029779374083 2022-02-28 14:09:09 -0800 <necho__> @A_di20 I‚Äôm gone try one. I know they‚Äôre on Amazon by the case

Sports is that kind of entertainment.  The owners have 1) facilities, and 2) team trademarks.   The players should make a TV deal with Apple or Amazon and play the regular season in abandoned minor league stadiums.
1498403688385179648 2022-02-28 13:04:12 -0800 <NButkis51> @indianaboognish @pixfiber So who is the oligarch?  Your team said Bezos, then they claimed bezos raised the Amazon minimum wage to $18.00 due to pressure from bernie sanders.   Thats not an example of oligarchy! üòÇ

1498399408735535105 2022-02-28 12:47:12 -0800 <BonesMoses> Amazon's Schema Conversion Tool is a GLX application. Nearly all modern Linux systems disable GLX ssh X forwarding for security reasons. Meaning it's basically impossible to use it on headless systems. Good job @amazon !

1498386187094040582 2022-02-28 11:54:40 -0800 <TraceyRyniec> @amazonholder1 Many of us don't want the world's largest corporation recording us on video going from place to place inside the store every time we shop and then taking that data and using it. They already do it on Amazon's website.
1498383814854389768 2022-02-28 11:45:14 -0800 <CuriousInvest19> @FromValue That‚Äôs kind of a naive take considering the amount of regulation and compliance in the medical industry. No way Amazon can navigate those waters
1498383270307848194 2022-02-28 11:43:04 -0800 <MBDChicago> Amazing that Amazon thought at least $100 million worth of viewers will tune in to hear Sean McVay when a majority of people have no idea who is doing color commentary on the average NFL broadcast.
1498376684130779139 2022-02-28 11:16:54 -0800 <URGzzzzz> @jspeiser @ChiefFoodTaster @amazon It'd be like if a pharmaceutical company spent years developing something and then a conglomerate of Walgreens/CVS/etc stopped stocking their drug while making their own and keeping the proprietary product's markups in place.

No more data. finished scraping!! is it though? because sometimes twitter lie haha.
