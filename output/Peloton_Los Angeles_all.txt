1500573531439988740 2022-03-06 12:46:23 -0800 <tweeterisimo> Tip #2. You don't have to wake up at 5am to work out like that lunatic CEO said in their autobiography, but you do have to work out every few days. Finding time for it every day is my preference. @onepeloton has great instructors and a mix of cardio/strength/flexibility.

1499822772238774272 2022-03-04 11:03:08 -0800 <EntStrategyGuy> BTW, this is my standing argument against half the valuations of unicorns whose TAM I think is mainly upper 20% of earners, not every day folks. (Think Uber, AirBNB, Peloton, food/grocery deliver, etc)
1499818297369391104 2022-03-04 10:45:22 -0800 <jf3co> - It's an acronym: Physical Exercise Education Kit... a mirror or something, more nails in the Peloton coffin  - It's a rollable external monitor... the future is here, and it's in a tube!

You should consider putting a list of exercises in the description of each class so if someone has say a shoulder injury and can't do certain moves, they know to just take another class instead!
