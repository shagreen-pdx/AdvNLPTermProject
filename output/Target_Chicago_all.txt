I have been a fan of hers for the last 5 years, ever since I saw her @CNBC appearances and her bold Tesla price target. I am a former Tesla shareholder after all. 3/x

1500858919731744769 2022-03-07 07:40:25 -0800 <dahosek> @LisaLBellamy I think of the scene in War Games where Matthew Broderick has the “I wish I didn’t know” speech, along with Professor Falken’s fatalistic declaration about living near a nuclear target, at least once a week even before the current crisis.
1500855399205031940 2022-03-07 07:26:26 -0800 <hatchplay> Turns out version 1 of HatchPlay's email mechanism needed some changes. It target #dotnet framework 4.6 and I needed to retarget to #dotnetcore so I can develop on my MacBook. I even had a whole separate website for managing the transactional emails.

1500842850606538760 2022-03-07 06:36:34 -0800 <nickfarina> @zakiscorner The joke is…Zaki gave ZSJL a solid A review and has been outspoken about how much he digs it. It’s because he doesn’t subscribe to their utterly  bizarre “victory or death” mindset that he becomes a target for this stupidity. How embarrassing for them.
1500841861564571648 2022-03-07 06:32:38 -0800 <lookwhatdrewdid> @JammelCutler So when I started typing that tweet, I was thinking he and the Nets are putting him in an even worse position.  Because he’ll be on the bench but not in uniform, he’ll be a sitting duck.   At least if he played he’d be a moving (and theoretically distracted) target.

After some great feedback from agents who liked where I was going, I realized it was 2 books crammed together. Now I’m at 95k. I wasn’t the exception

1500806378469924864 2022-03-07 04:11:38 -0800 <eversmilingguy> @Infaredlight @Skinlike_pearls @hmsouthafrica They're physically accessible to their Target Market.  It Creates a chain of Cons like Damaged reputation due to Technical Issues, Support, increased returns etc, and that's why they don't have eCommerce, not only in SA, but most 1st world countries other than UK.
1500803568630177795 2022-03-07 04:00:29 -0800 <geoman52> Since we can’t play out from the back, we really need a Lukaku-like #9 to be a target man and an option in the counter. #MUFC

I made sure it was the quickest Target run lol  Imma post pictures on FB. She’s gotten so big. She needed some big sister time today. She laid on me just like she used to when she was a toddler 😭
1500672715656626177 2022-03-06 19:20:31 -0800 <Luv2Bowl99> @davechensky Your complaint would be valid if there was any indication that those thugs picked him because he was Asian. It seemed to me that he was a target because he got up to leave the train. Also the movie was filmed before the surge of anti Asian crime so you are off base here.
1500668645890048001 2022-03-06 19:04:20 -0800 <jeffreytgilbert> So @jakub_pomykala, why don’t any of these l10n i18n services let you type/define/scope the keys to show and/or limit character length on translations? App devs must know the target size already. Db cols have it!

1500647341589549056 2022-03-06 17:39:41 -0800 <helenrottier> @HeidiStevens13 That's my favorite Target!
1500646765988569098 2022-03-06 17:37:24 -0800 <SamGreszes> Yes, they are real. No, they're not hard to find. There was a box of them at Target, right next to the other Easter jellybeans. Someone could presumably buy this without looking closely and think they weren't deeply, deeply cursed
1500644963566211078 2022-03-06 17:30:14 -0800 <ayo_tricky> @zvvmbs Target would never
1500644070800171011 2022-03-06 17:26:41 -0800 <hzsong> 4/Also, the target is decided before Russian invasion of Ukraine. Since most indicators suggest the economy has strengthened recently, it is not a big surprise Beijing sets the target higher than forecasts made months ago (mine included)
1500644067226566658 2022-03-06 17:26:40 -0800 <hzsong> 1/My take on Beijing's 5.5% growth target. IMO, the growth target doesn't tells us much new about China's 2022 policy outlook. This is because 2022 economic policy has already been decided at last December's central economic work conference (CEWC).
1500643749629775873 2022-03-06 17:25:25 -0800 <allshiny> @johnanewquist I’m going to go to a different Target and see if they have more colors in my size. There was a black one that would work but it was too small… hopefully a bigger store will have more options.

CHANGE: Round ends at Friday, 8:00pm instead of Saturday at 11:59pm (this is to make sure that everyone gets a fair shot of killing their target)   DURATION: Monday, 3PM- Friday, 8PM  92 people left!!
1500623707483553792 2022-03-06 16:05:46 -0800 <DanTheCentrist> @Cernovich The truth is always at center court. Just find the midpoint between ukrainian reports and russian reports and you're probably over the target.
1500616315899363329 2022-03-06 15:36:24 -0800 <HHr63294723> I think ordinary Russians can make a huge difference if they stage a attack on a key Russian target.
1500616313735368705 2022-03-06 15:36:23 -0800 <wishliluck> Best thing they ever did was curbside pickup @ Target.

1500605774459854852 2022-03-06 14:54:31 -0800 <AndersChiTown> If you’re in the oil industry and high oil prices are good for you, enjoy it. Soon you will become a target. See how easy governments seized Russian assets? Will happen here too.

The way these tests are written and scored though do not give information about skills in the target subject or assess progress in standards.  The history of our standardized test obsession in America has only caused harm to kids and profit to companies.😩

1500573904108142599 2022-03-06 12:47:52 -0800 <lore_chiroptera> @Insalora It's a dog-whistle that TERFs frequently use to intentionally target trans women. The “woman = adult human female” slogan is often associated with Posie Parker, founder of the anti-trans group Standing For Women.

1500572481949679616 2022-03-06 12:42:13 -0800 <wineallergy> It’s a law that if you’re hungover in an empty target bathroom the 10 loudest customers must immediately enter and terrorize you while Ed Sheeran plays over tin speakers
1500568269748584452 2022-03-06 12:25:29 -0800 <JakeLohrke> I'm a big fan of trying supermarket knockoff brands to see how they match up. Cheesters (Meijer cheezits) are pretty good and a lot cheaper. Target "rounds" (Ritz crackers) are straight up better
1500563843122147337 2022-03-06 12:07:53 -0800 <destini_janae> and then the kicker is when they get mad when the person doesn’t respond in 5 minutes😭😭like bae,,, go to target or some?
1500563807264931845 2022-03-06 12:07:45 -0800 <rishijmehta> @LNGKwhyyy @BountyHunterNFT Yezzzir! Target incoming haha
1500563099132346375 2022-03-06 12:04:56 -0800 <danibabe__> I can never buy my pants from Target that’s the only thing. That is literally for whites only.
1500562924976410626 2022-03-06 12:04:15 -0800 <2witches2come> @ZenSmoke @QasimRashid I have a friend who's a Target employee--it's not actually across the board. My understanding is it's a COL adjustment depending on where the store is located--so that might still be a starvation wage in LA where the cost of housing is ridiculous.
1500562843036495872 2022-03-06 12:03:55 -0800 <ShamontielV> @_S_choir It's definitely not always free. For example, you have to subscribe to Amazon Prime to get Whole Foods to do it. Target won't pick out a BUNCH of groceries (not even bread) for pickup. By the time you pick and choose, you may as well go in the store.
1500557201097871362 2022-03-06 11:41:30 -0800 <chicagolandish> @fiaanaut @jcenters My response to your hysteria is "you do you and I'll do me." If you want to go out to a primary target and greet the bomb with arms wide open, yelling "roast me, Vlad," go for it. I'm 100% OK with the thought of you choosing death over hardship, for yourself.
1500557069518262278 2022-03-06 11:40:59 -0800 <loganzinman> My villain origin story is these goddamn Target juniors momjean shorts that don’t fit over my actual momhips.
1500555628154175491 2022-03-06 11:35:15 -0800 <lilrongal> @TheSimmingKoala Maybe, but I'd think they'd be able to get them wholesale rather than from Target, no?
1500554798222954500 2022-03-06 11:31:57 -0800 <danibabe__> Omg y’all I was depressed. I went to Target and I feel so much better
1500554638352916482 2022-03-06 11:31:19 -0800 <slamtrav> I did that thing again where I go to target and buy a bunch of shit I don’t need
1500552583223648263 2022-03-06 11:23:09 -0800 <jax__c> Traders Joes in Roscoe Village - 80% masked Mariano’s in Bucktown - 30% masked Local Foods - 95% masked  Target in Bucktown - 50% masked
1500546787240812549 2022-03-06 11:00:07 -0800 <TheLeftNipple> @lilstov Girl yes! I got one the next day!! Target had a 50% off sale 😭😭 destiny went and pick it up for me!
1500546346046173186 2022-03-06 10:58:22 -0800 <Slipshocktv> @aTruFlash Thats when I'll get it then. Just kinda sucks because plan with friends cut in half because of how barebones some features are. Im probably not the target audience because I was only going to play gm mode and that doesn't feel like it justifies the purchase anymore
1500543282786537476 2022-03-06 10:46:12 -0800 <Profootballboy> @_TyAnderson Left shot D. ... Are Blues in love with Torey Krug? Could he be a target for reacquisition. Would clearly upgrade power player, and viable puck mover and defender.
1500542896008843266 2022-03-06 10:44:39 -0800 <TyroneLoveBulls> @SethRol05972053 @BluesWillly @ga11agbon @Zigic_Header can't be comparing Fatty Abgonlahor to the best target man
1500542188589137923 2022-03-06 10:41:51 -0800 <jdwakefield> @AssusReamus He won't need to. Besides, he hasn't got the diesel to get that far. 'Someone' will make an unfortunate 'error'...hold a map upside down or some other nonsense and light up a railway station or a bridge that wasn't on a target list.
1500538023498428418 2022-03-06 10:25:18 -0800 <saifsrathore> Hey @Target, charging us for a gift card when we’re supposed to get one kind of defeats the purpose of the promotion
1500536734894931971 2022-03-06 10:20:10 -0800 <jpfit_4life> What happens when you stretch a muscle?  Your body takes action by improving blood flow to that area.   The blood vessels near the target muscles widen,   Allowing more blood to flow through,   And your heart begins pumping more blood.   #jpfit4life
1500532930824876036 2022-03-06 10:05:03 -0800 <danibabe__> Starbucks, car detailed, and Target. Happy Sunday!
1500526823406505989 2022-03-06 09:40:47 -0800 <TadBad> Last night my SO &amp; I discussed our own potential options if it comes that no one can stop Putin from going full nuclear.  (We'd be a target in Chicago, 3rd largest US city &amp; key transportation hub.)  If able to choose I'd rather be killed upon strike than try to survive...
1500524491084029959 2022-03-06 09:31:31 -0800 <ElyeseTarryn> @FavorisntfairC @OhDuhDaniel @HolePunchSD @dariusdrums @BcraigV @RobIsRandomAF_6 YAAAAAAAAZSSSZZZZZZ target said we outchere!!! Chicago may have these small plots of land but we will build a five story target if necessary!
1500524221558099971 2022-03-06 09:30:27 -0800 <Christ__King> @bello_ricky @WGNNews It's an easy target for easy points.  His approval numbers are low because he caters to everyone but does nothing.  All words for points.
1500518823363022848 2022-03-06 09:09:00 -0800 <g_e_r_m_a_n_p> What prescription drug ads target you the most?
1500517716226195461 2022-03-06 09:04:36 -0800 <Kris10Speaks> I'm going to Target for two things. Dassit.
1500514415095001100 2022-03-06 08:51:29 -0800 <DW102080> New super power discovered, leaving @Target empty handed.
1500513478834110469 2022-03-06 08:47:46 -0800 <Lukeadams> @PaulCogan @chasehrlich Also: who tf cares if they were given a warning by ppl who know better than they do... are we talking bout teachers taking a $3M loss or the politicians? The teachers!!  Maybe try a different target... cuz clearly all you have is speculation.
1500512495634681858 2022-03-06 08:43:51 -0800 <MattGoldrick> @yuvalmarton @yoavgo @tallinzen Usually language scientists (neurologists/linguists/psycholinguists) label errors by similarity to the target. A semantic error has similar meaning, a formal error / malapropism is related in sound, etc.
1500511882150617088 2022-03-06 08:41:25 -0800 <emilyryantweets> Went to @Target Drive up to pickup a bday present for a kids birthday and the target employee brought it to car and saw my kids and was so thoughtful to ask “just want to make sure this isn’t for your kids in case they cant see it.” Loved that - she didn’t have to consider that.
1500509860751982596 2022-03-06 08:33:23 -0800 <FavorisntfairC> @OhDuhDaniel @HolePunchSD @dariusdrums @BcraigV @RobIsRandomAF_6 I love this one and mess with the one in Oak Lawn and the Super Target in Tinley Park.
1500505596906385408 2022-03-06 08:16:27 -0800 <NieDaddy> what if... I walk to the Target that's... near the pet supply store... which might have fish... hmm...
1500504361910292483 2022-03-06 08:11:32 -0800 <ESPN1000> Which position or area should the Bears target with their first draft pick?  @BrianHanley534 and @Zanderocker will discuss this and more until noon
1500504064207032324 2022-03-06 08:10:21 -0800 <minimaysun> CVS is to Walgreens what Walmart is to Target
1500501904144670735 2022-03-06 08:01:46 -0800 <StreetervilleC> @Target Target, shouldn't all of us be encouraged to celebrate and elevate? Do you promote this type of clothing for all different groups of Americans?
1500500547333509129 2022-03-06 07:56:23 -0800 <danibabe__> I have been to Target in awhile, am I depressed? If so I probably need to go to Target
1500499589606031363 2022-03-06 07:52:34 -0800 <JamesGierach> @MeetThePress @stavridisj @NATO @UN_PGA Plan B: locate, target and eliminate Putin. @MeetThePress
1500496110158233607 2022-03-06 07:38:45 -0800 <Eric78915> @TleilaxuMentat @lawlfirm @tassagency_en So, again, absolutely nothing you have said even remotely supports an argument that Afghanistan was not a legitimate target after 9/11.
1500495761192423425 2022-03-06 07:37:21 -0800 <Eric78915> @TleilaxuMentat @lawlfirm @tassagency_en Nothing you just said refutes that’s Afghanistan was a legitimate target.  All you are arguing is that Saudi Arabia also was one.
1500490354595966980 2022-03-06 07:15:52 -0800 <lostinchicago_> brb gonna walk into target for one thing &amp; black out
1500487249292578824 2022-03-06 07:03:32 -0800 <I_go_shock_U> @Sagir4real1 @DailyPostNGR I swearugod, Dey are up to something. All of them! Maybe they couldn't get their target with the covid outbreak hence the need for all these drama, Or it's a way to get back to China for their past dicey moves. The ongoing war is definetly a chess like game. No one can tell!
1500481020382130178 2022-03-06 06:38:47 -0800 <supilowski__c> @ElyseCara1 I have to appreciate that someone includes Target as a hobby/interest.
1500477215183679490 2022-03-06 06:23:40 -0800 <_ABYLE> Target gotta change the prices at the register. Ain’t no way
1500475097525669889 2022-03-06 06:15:15 -0800 <Eric_Erins> It’s walk to target weather
1500473063254728708 2022-03-06 06:07:10 -0800 <protectedbylisa> @sofiafoster Walmart was the first target was the second.
1500470176839614468 2022-03-06 05:55:42 -0800 <worldofequip> @VideoGamesPlus_ @reverov @Wario64 @REDARTGAMES Also curious if the PS5 version will be available at Target as well. Thanks!
1500454939314774022 2022-03-06 04:55:09 -0800 <B_Gustafson74> @The_MJ_effect Next time I'm in the laundry room I'll take a picture. Looks like the detergent aisle at target.
1500442541442883597 2022-03-06 04:05:53 -0800 <leopet7> @Ukr The obvious way to inflict economic pain would be to target the oil and gas exports Russia’s biggest source of currency. The scale of the costs that would impose on Europe, make such a measure a true double edged sword if Russia calculate that the cost on Europe is too high
1500432236373544964 2022-03-06 03:24:56 -0800 <chicagolandish> @fiaanaut @jcenters If the crisis passes and civilization is still here, at least one got out of town for a while. If the worst happens, and you made sure to choose a hovel that wasn't near a military base or other nuclear target, at least you won't be incinerated.
1500405657920585728 2022-03-06 01:39:19 -0800 <RadFemme74> @bella_dingdong @pennysweets4tw1 @GPair10 @KatyMontgomerie @jk_rowling @ShonaRobison You all seem completely uninterested in it unless you can use it to target trans women. There's far more of it in the home than anywhere else, and yet you never say anything about that.
1500362292956905472 2022-03-05 22:47:00 -0800 <honeysc_> i love you target
1500350480358129669 2022-03-05 22:00:04 -0800 <CSI_Starbase> @therussianhack F-22’s are multi role fighters. They can attack any surface or air target that exists.  That’s the main reason for stealth. Deep penetration missions. You are very mistaken.
1500341121024724998 2022-03-05 21:22:52 -0800 <randa_rkive> @letstalkabtsuga target! their stuff is actually really cute and affordable. also shein is good for online but i always make sure to look at the reviews because the fit of the sizing can vary
1500339093024161794 2022-03-05 21:14:49 -0800 <salkken> @GeensDangles @paws_not_claws @janegilbert @mehdirhasan If Hamas didn't launch rockets at Israeli civilians--a terrorist act and war crime you likely support--Israel wouldn't need to target Hamas terrorists. I guess that's LMAO to you.
1500318526992797701 2022-03-05 19:53:06 -0800 <emcarr42> @alexsteed I saw it in a theatre last week after work and it was only me (24f) and three 30something men in the entire place. I may not be the target audience, but it so fun to just watch a bunch of dudes who have been friends  for 20 years just doing dumb shit and making others laugh
1500314534531186690 2022-03-05 19:37:14 -0800 <auntiecoley_> Target closes at 10. Will I make it?
1500309416087805958 2022-03-05 19:16:53 -0800 <RadFemme74> @GPair10 @AlleyyyyKat @KatyMontgomerie @jk_rowling @ShonaRobison The most dangerous place for a girl is her own home, and the most dangerous man, her own father. Your spaces do nothing to address that. And it's telling how you never talk about that. Then again you can't use it to target trans women so you don't care.
1500308986628874241 2022-03-05 19:15:11 -0800 <RadFemme74> @WomanchesterMMN @HanoverHussy @jk_rowling @ShonaRobison @Womans_Place_UK The most dangerous man to a girl, is her father, by a huge margin. The most dangerous man to a woman, is one she knows. Tell me what your vaunted spaces can do to protect either of them? you go on about safety yet never talk about stuff like that. Cause you need a target.
1500308795397971968 2022-03-05 19:14:25 -0800 <GoAwayWithJae> @jangmi57 No, the U.S. Target sells it!
1500308156739686400 2022-03-05 19:11:53 -0800 <RadFemme74> @SophieXY44 @jk_rowling @ShonaRobison The most dangerous man to a girl, by orders of magnitude, is her own father. But you all don't care about that cause you can't use it to target trans women.  you just demand that trans women must be treated as a problem and that when we are hurt it must be seen  as what we deserv
1500306512010436608 2022-03-05 19:05:21 -0800 <brute_tom> @Ninepenneth @JimmySecUK They painted that stupid target Z even on their garbage trucks. I suspect this will be the same.
1500302750894247942 2022-03-05 18:50:24 -0800 <VinnyVino_> @HowdyNFTs I buy stupid derivative projects all the time. I should’ve been a prime target 😭
1500299836947640320 2022-03-05 18:38:50 -0800 <alemaynee> Target has so much baby stuff on sale and it’s so hard to not shop for my child 😭.
1500297681196957700 2022-03-05 18:30:16 -0800 <windycitymo9> @CatsNDogs14 @nekkidititty @ianbremmer Your response was right on target A state that demonizes border immigrant, almost entirely ripped away women's abortion rights and elected Ted Cruz as a senator is just majorly f#@#$# up. Too bad nutcase Texas is dragging down other states in the Union.Florida is in the race too
1500296246619160576 2022-03-05 18:24:34 -0800 <DannyFantym> Come to think of it, I’ve never had a raggedy cart at target. Looking at you @Walmart.
1500292237615378438 2022-03-05 18:08:38 -0800 <sr_sammiii> I found the cutest sweater ever at target today for only $12 so my life is actually amazing
1500287677991641090 2022-03-05 17:50:31 -0800 <spintheiryarns> i do have a big pickup order of CLEANING SUPPLIES waiting at target, which is basically like getting started on spring cleaning. i have so much decluttering to do  does anyone by any chance want to come over next sunday to like hang out and be moral support while i weed my closet
1500286673258782725 2022-03-05 17:46:31 -0800 <NurseMindy00> It’s weird that most US liberals don’t trust Putin when he says he wants to target Nazis, but take Biden’s side with targeting “Nazis”.
1500278398609985542 2022-03-05 17:13:38 -0800 <MightyAxeMan> @itsginnydi Rogues don't need flanking to get Sneak Attack, they just need an ally adjacent to the target. Flanking would give Advantage, and Rogues can Sneak Attack when they have Advantage, but if they're getting Advantage from flanking they already have an ally adjacent to the target.
1500275596185804802 2022-03-05 17:02:30 -0800 <AntiNewDems> Im going to start politely challenging them on teh Science. Lord knows urban America is a target rich environment for green hairs who haven’t paid an iota of attention to the shifting and collapsing rationales. These hipster doofuses pride themselves on being non-comformists too.
1500256657233825794 2022-03-05 15:47:15 -0800 <Its___Lilly> @TONYMAPP The target by my house hands me a pre-sanitized cart every time I walk in. Why would I deprive myself of this experience 🤣
1500256460017647616 2022-03-05 15:46:28 -0800 <theycallmerece> Target got the fire pico de gallo. Who would've thunk it?
1500253361639239682 2022-03-05 15:34:09 -0800 <suspectcelery> @TerrestrialTTV Lucky target find in Wisconsin! Lol
1500251633795674114 2022-03-05 15:27:17 -0800 <DATheHighGuy> @Mnewman37Newman @YouTube Exactly. The final world War has already began. I'm scared. We all are. I don't see this ending soon.   It's an embarrassment that the USA has abandoned its post.  If Russia goes big boom happy, we are their first target. Especially even if not involved.  It's Russian tactics.
1500246237152428038 2022-03-05 15:05:50 -0800 <SoccerSaber> @wee_rogue Yes this makes much more sense than assigning all shots off target the same value. A scout would never evaluate a player that way so our models shouldn't either.
1500240370856247300 2022-03-05 14:42:32 -0800 <consiencious> Im sure a broke 25 year old who cant get out of there basement because there witheld pay and are beaten is an easy target but i just want to move out How is that okay to beat and take someones ideas why is that okay please fucking tell me why this is okay
1500239773302149128 2022-03-05 14:40:09 -0800 <ctrlzee> @edelstudio and somehow they solely target the things we know for sure
1500237415172214795 2022-03-05 14:30:47 -0800 <connortomasko> this must be the place just came on in target
1500230493756968971 2022-03-05 14:03:17 -0800 <LikeThisMonse> not me about to go back into the loop just to go to a target that has cutwater 😵‍💫
1500224495868592129 2022-03-05 13:39:27 -0800 <UNDRSCORE87FGC> @NYDanteT Skateboards at Target are 10 bucks
1500215356484468747 2022-03-05 13:03:08 -0800 <amo2009> Today has been one of those crazy mom marathons: Target for birthday gifts, dishes, grocery shopping, unload groceries/clean fridge, take kid to piano, more dishes, call furnace guy, and next driving kid to birthday party no.2.
1500212859527127044 2022-03-05 12:53:12 -0800 <christweetsllc> @Kittenfish817 Oh sorry the main character can simply physical transmit himself basically across the universe and even into different realms of the living and dead  if he fixates on where a target is

1500204568302477312 2022-03-05 12:20:16 -0800 <TheStoneRL> @Mike_Pence US/NATO is running the show - as they always did. The Comedian is not even a bad joke. Top target to turn Ukraine 2022 into Afghanistan in the 80s, remixed. With a Neo-Nazi International in the previous role of Jihad Inc.  The same old imperial play book.
1500202188362108928 2022-03-05 12:10:48 -0800 <martinpinnau> Grocery tip for people in the Chicago area. Several times when I haven't been able to find a product at Walmart, Target, Jewel, or Meijer, I have found it at Woodman's. You can even search the Woodman's website to see if they have what you're looking for in-stock.
1500198241522094084 2022-03-05 11:55:07 -0800 <CarlosFreytesJr> @marcbernardin Ok god. It’s moved me to tears three times, including one where I was laughing that I was crying in a Target parking lot.
1500190943064039435 2022-03-05 11:26:07 -0800 <creoIepatra> People will say as a black person they not buying "etc" but you shop at Walmart, Target, you eat fast food, you buy from luxury brands. It's all the same. Just because Kylie and nem pushed to the forefront, don't mean these other CORPORATIONS aren't just as bad, even worse.
1500189948841967618 2022-03-05 11:22:10 -0800 <TurdFurgesonn> I think Target is my new favourite shop.
1500187810913001478 2022-03-05 11:13:40 -0800 <tonikagj> @webgrazer @BlockClubCHI Further more I didn’t TARGET neglected properties, THE ENTIRE point of the project on Land Sale Contracts is to demonstrate that the OVERWHELMING MAJORITY of the Land Sale Contract homes are visibly neglected and ABANDONED or now vacant lots!
1500186010965184527 2022-03-05 11:06:31 -0800 <cwidma3> @cmclymer @DaikonForTurnip Too bad she didn't try to get out earlier. She was the perfect target for Putin. Now he will want to deal to get who he wants from us. Prisoner exchange.
1500181779747123208 2022-03-05 10:49:42 -0800 <Profootballboy> Are Blues still in love with Torrey Krug? Wondering if he could be a trade target for Bruins, who could have second thoughts about letting him go.
1500181638520655876 2022-03-05 10:49:09 -0800 <Dr_Dre_uhh> Target has overalls. I repeat, target has overalls
1500181029448994817 2022-03-05 10:46:44 -0800 <illanumi> I be so offended when certain people shoot their shot at me, like you’re not my target demographic leave!!!
1500179510800564224 2022-03-05 10:40:42 -0800 <TruDemEileen> @CREWcrew I think prosecutors and AGs are praying a crazed person follows Grahams advice but with target change. They certainly are driving all of us crazy.
1500178512501743627 2022-03-05 10:36:44 -0800 <Dmitry_US_UA> @sentdefender @taxfreelt Easy target, if it is true.
1500175485988491267 2022-03-05 10:24:42 -0800 <el_en_nuhh> WHY MY MOM HAD TO STOP MY EX’S STEP MOM AT TARGET ??? TELL YOUR STEP SON HE A BITCH but i’ll still get coffee with you girl
1500174620388900866 2022-03-05 10:21:16 -0800 <neil_tijerina> This Brittney Griner thing is bigger than anything having to do with race or LGBTQ issues. Gotta demand her release immediately.  Putin is using her as a pawn in his mission for more power. Dude is straight scum and will target innocent people no matter who they are
1500173754432950273 2022-03-05 10:17:49 -0800 <T_FllwdBy_K> Bout to take my baby to the park and out favorite place target for toys lol
1500171154618785793 2022-03-05 10:07:29 -0800 <ShanyePorter> Need to go to Target or the beauty supply to buy makeup.
1500171125246119938 2022-03-05 10:07:22 -0800 <MannyBuckley> all the lesbians were in target this morning  you love to see it
1500164584635838466 2022-03-05 09:41:23 -0800 <TheReal_M_C> @RexChapman @AceBoogie910 yes she is. she was an easy target for sure. there is nothing wrong with marijuana IMO. but this is a different country with different laws in the middle of a war with hatred towards the west. she should have known better then to risk that in this current climate
1500164186273374209 2022-03-05 09:39:48 -0800 <TheReal_M_C> @RexChapman Laws are different all around the world. Some places will execute for having drugs. While I have ZERO issue with anything marijuana related, she should have known better that this is the wrong time to have something illegal in a country that has a huge target on anyone from USA
1500161845939822597 2022-03-05 09:30:30 -0800 <ThaNakedChef> @AllthetimeWeho Lmao the fact u keep replying. The fact u said target. The fact it’s your profile pic. Get out ya moms basement. Go get a life and stop trolling on the Internet this “airbrushed” ass has opened up doors for me your mother couldn’t open up for any of her pathetic children. Bye now
1500161782421278721 2022-03-05 09:30:15 -0800 <FrankenberryDeb> @OG_Tek1 @linzsports She also knows she’s a target
1500161699034411014 2022-03-05 09:29:55 -0800 <TheReal_M_C> @BleacherReport @interfax_news @David_SB621  She should have known better then to have anything with her in this current climate as she is an easy target by the Russians.
1500159474237161476 2022-03-05 09:21:04 -0800 <AJManaseer> @CDRosa @BebopOtt Why don’t you @ me next time, cowards.   And no, nobody is “obsessed” with any of you. We just know who is weak and therefore who to target come Feb 28th, 2023.
1500155731848404993 2022-03-05 09:06:12 -0800 <seanv112> @benwehrman @ButtFarm69 @PlatnumSparkles @jonstewart Listening to Jon he knows who the bill could go to.. But what would you target?
1500153718397886471 2022-03-05 08:58:12 -0800 <theekarlag> @cathyb_xoxo @31_ForeverYoung They at Target!
1500149804013342724 2022-03-05 08:42:39 -0800 <FearlessRiOT> @time_novelist I do, actually. Simple Plan was big back when I was in the pre-teen target demographic for them and I did listen to them quite a bit at the time.
1500139508871933968 2022-03-05 08:01:44 -0800 <Robbygoldd> @bonitarosekemp @JoshuaPotash If you are advocating for the establishment of a no-fly zone, Putin will directly target the countries who help create one with nuclear weapons. That would be a stupid escalation with worldwide consequences. It’s a stupid idea, full stop.
1500138705742446592 2022-03-05 07:58:33 -0800 <stormstrike4119> @XxFirecracker Target and Starbucks doesn’t count! 😂
1500134285835182080 2022-03-05 07:40:59 -0800 <cestyF_> @Onegrimreaper_ @Target bruh
1500131866992648205 2022-03-05 07:31:22 -0800 <ForeverAKay_> Target + Starbucks run. ♥️
1500127211839492098 2022-03-05 07:12:52 -0800 <StarGhost1999> By Bombing civilians Putin is sending only one message. No one especially America, Europe and the West is coming to save you or help you. I will bomb you indiscrimately, I will target nuclear power plants I will do what I want and they do nothing,even for NATO countries, nothing.
1500125598265458690 2022-03-05 07:06:28 -0800 <Quisxx> Hope we bump into each other one day in target or something 😭🤞🏾
1500125080877207556 2022-03-05 07:04:24 -0800 <chrisdidato> @greenfieldjohn At 1 time, yrs ago, I got on train at 18th St. to go W. There was a man going home after work. Another man chose this man to hit. I told the man who was targeted to go to another car &amp; kept the man who wanted to hit the guy in the car, giving the target the ability to move/leave.
1500114588335063043 2022-03-05 06:22:43 -0800 <Savy2Smooth> @PunditsPund1 1 seed level regular season winning success and some things that come with it is cool but another thing that comes with it is that major target on the back. Having that target means you’re very good but this season has always been about just making the playoffs for the Bulls
1500111220791287808 2022-03-05 06:09:20 -0800 <CunningVet> @QTWIQ1 Depends on the target.
1500110077398822915 2022-03-05 06:04:47 -0800 <FFas354> They will leave the religion as an arrow leaves its target, and they will not return to it as the arrow does not return to its bow. They are the worst of the creation. Blessed are those who fight them and are killed by them.
1500109906128551940 2022-03-05 06:04:06 -0800 <lambert5106> @Suntimes With these programs, someone ALWAYS helps THEMSELVES rather than the target group.
1500106814058373126 2022-03-05 05:51:49 -0800 <reftpt> @samagreene Are there any actions the West could take to target the elites that they haven’t already?
1500103318454083585 2022-03-05 05:37:56 -0800 <agentjay2009> @AjmalsaeedPk @AamnaFasihi Yes, telegram we will use based on everyone's advice. But total active WhatsApp users are 2 billion and total telegram users are 400 million I think. Plus, our target audience is likely to have WhatsApp but not necessarily Telegram
1500095063245873153 2022-03-05 05:05:08 -0800 <TheeChicagoWay> @CPD1617Scanner Do you know if he was the target/reason for the search warrant on the 3rd floor at the ymca?
1500060601913122821 2022-03-05 02:48:11 -0800 <stevevanprooyen> @expatua @Ukrainolution They will be target practice for snipers
1499990276563255299 2022-03-04 22:08:45 -0800 <_kzirbes> @Maxamil89 @babecicada Its in the little section at target when you first walk in where everything is like $3/$5 and it was the only one otherwise I would have bought so many
1499988452141633536 2022-03-04 22:01:30 -0800 <agentjay2009> @naveedsview I think you are right, lots of people claiming that messages can be sent centrally to thousands of users at once, but haven’t found a viable option. Telegram has that option, but WhatsApp is the main target ... will also see if people download Telegram especially for this purpose
1499985317096525824 2022-03-04 21:49:02 -0800 <e_elenaaaa> @lwgowin @jpklock @OfficerPorkChop @MaryAnnAhernNBC @SAKimFoxx It wasn’t dumb, sorry. Certain corners of this country love to share their racist fantasies about how they think Chicago functions, and Kim Foxx, regardless of her efficacy, is often the target of those ill formed opinions.
1499984143119265805 2022-03-04 21:44:22 -0800 <obladioblada987> Their vibe is young millennial/ geriatric gen-z angst underneath an ironic layer of "fuck it might as well have fun" and I'm just the perfect target demographic
1499980808786006017 2022-03-04 21:31:07 -0800 <waynephtr> @jenwhitexxx Target and then Ice Cream
1499978073394974724 2022-03-04 21:20:15 -0800 <ChiaWatchItGrow> @unusual_whales If we cut off all China exports, there would be no walmart, target, home depot, Costco, Apple, and so on.
1499968896777994240 2022-03-04 20:43:47 -0800 <RyanBruno7287> @NiceMangos I do not follow Dave Rubin. Sorry if i stole a talking point there. But my point stands. She doesn’t target groups of people, like bigots do. She targets bad ideas. Again, I have strong disagreements with her, but I don’t conflate disagreement with bigotry.
1499968350725750785 2022-03-04 20:41:37 -0800 <SollySollinger> @PixelRosen @TimInHonolulu They shot at it… suggests they either don’t know what their target it or they don’t give a shit
1499964720274722816 2022-03-04 20:27:11 -0800 <patrickfcox_cox> @RadioFreeTom Ok, so what’s the next step if we provoke Putin? If US and NATO planes enter and start an air war against Russian air forces in Ukraine.  What is Putin’s nuclear response?  What is his target? The US or Europe? Tactical use in Ukraine or full on armeggedon launch against the US?
1499953192490184705 2022-03-04 19:41:23 -0800 <gameism> @axl99 Ugh I had to Alt-F4 for the night. Just got 4-hit juggled to death by a gnome in a dungeon and like, come on. I could SEE it there but couldn't target it 'till I entered the plane of the room and then it insta-jumped me. Like, FFS.
1499951819698679808 2022-03-04 19:35:56 -0800 <megbon> Today at Target a song was playing that had the lyric “in the bed, she’s a maniac/ I her head, she’s a brainiac.” And that leans in so hard to corny, it may have broached genius.
1499951665516060679 2022-03-04 19:35:19 -0800 <FearlessRiOT> @HellcatPerez I bought my first Shida figure on Ringside because I assumed she'd be hard to find one on store shelves. She's actually been very easy to find at Target's, so I feel like I wasted money on Ringside.
1499950350161305601 2022-03-04 19:30:05 -0800 <FearlessRiOT> @HellcatPerez Wal-Mart's around her are becoming less reliable when it comes to wrestling figures in-general, both WWE and AEW. But Target always got something. That's were I bought my second Shida.
1499949304659812353 2022-03-04 19:25:56 -0800 <mexicaneaux> @seraph76 i’ve reached my target audience thank you
1499940814394470402 2022-03-04 18:52:12 -0800 <SavyLeiser> @EmmaTheGoblin Oh no!! Limited sizes SUCK. I had the best luck with BraStop. Idk where I'm gonna shop now... I'll start with target and then once I'm confident in knowing the new size, I'll find nicer stuff
1499938275418677253 2022-03-04 18:42:07 -0800 <suburbanoasis> @SherronShabazz You don’t teach them a lesson by hitting Allen, you do it by hitting Giannis. You don’t target Lambert for hitting Jordan, you target Isaiah.
1499934350246297605 2022-03-04 18:26:31 -0800 <denverr_00> i’m going to target this weekend, idc.
1499928449770786817 2022-03-04 18:03:04 -0800 <_kzirbes> ($5 at target btw)
1499928349744975878 2022-03-04 18:02:40 -0800 <RadFemme74> @peacelove1967 @DalgetySusan @soniasodha @MagiGibson Strange then that you all never address things like how the most dangerous men to girls and women, by orders of magnitude, are those they know. No man is as dangerous to a girl as her own father, yet you all go around only bringing up what allows you to target trans women.
1499927253089673216 2022-03-04 17:58:19 -0800 <Jessnj4554> @nexta_tv I hope all these news companies have ways to get their people out of the country safely. Seems like they could be a target of putin even after halting productions.
1499923427104231426 2022-03-04 17:43:06 -0800 <jcreech3> @Joshmedia A no fly zone means actively choosing to shoot down Russian jets. It also means our jets get shot at by surface to air missiles. It’s a bad deal when Putin wants a nuke target
1499922032229851136 2022-03-04 17:37:34 -0800 <smalljustin_il> @OW_Icicle @ryanlbstudios @ArkanulN @GuptaDron @DystopianRevolt @TechnicallyTee Dex is useful for a target market - as a person who also has a laptop and a desktop, I am not that target market. This is a lot of people buying a $1200 phone - it’s great for those who care, but it’s fundamentally niche.
1499911932207415296 2022-03-04 16:57:26 -0800 <BearlyNormal> @SurenaXMarie Oh totally. It's about the "target." It's why constructive feedback is about actionable things and specifics. You say "You did bad," that is value judgment. "I'm disappointed that you didn't take efforts to make Yi feel more included" and you know what the issue is.
1499908691843338240 2022-03-04 16:44:33 -0800 <Meeseeks_89> @RichLux713 @Sephora Eh, they sell vibrators at the drugstore and target. This isn’t weird to me. Also you have to search a while to find them in the app.
1499896247901044738 2022-03-04 15:55:06 -0800 <busstogate2141> @rickrudescalves Wager them target-to-target, most in the black or bullseye and if they don't, they are wimps.
1499895557711663107 2022-03-04 15:52:22 -0800 <OleanderPlume> @jkingmclaughlin @QasimRashid And another reason to love @Target.
1499894213911191552 2022-03-04 15:47:01 -0800 <SydCeleste> if y’all see me in Target this month, whoop my ass please. thank you.
1499881006177951751 2022-03-04 14:54:32 -0800 <kings_memoirs> @angelbbyface Oh I made my lips a target
1499871187182272516 2022-03-04 14:15:31 -0800 <SYabanozov> @georgi_stanoev What’s your target George?
1499870594711572482 2022-03-04 14:13:10 -0800 <gameism> @thedextriarchy Yeah! And like, extended stuff like how to find that one piece of armor or what the best builds are is great, but like, I shouldn't have to find out the hard way that if I'm in combat, I should be target locked. It does not communicate that non-target locked combat is ill advised
1499868216713256966 2022-03-04 14:03:43 -0800 <Derp_06> @Jdotosmith My target demo will be all up in there!
1499862877334872064 2022-03-04 13:42:30 -0800 <MikeUp> @jkfecke @imraansiddiqi Yeah, we save boring ol' Hellfires for civilian targets.  If dropping one of these on a civilian target would be "unforgivable", what would you call dropping cluster munitions and white phosphorus on population centers? "Troubling"?
1499859588501233665 2022-03-04 13:29:26 -0800 <sergiykhwork> @Wildgrisen666 @BRAAComp @kevinlaughlin @Shayan86 This may be an exaggeration, but there is an intelligence data that Zelensky is a target.
1499855031323041798 2022-03-04 13:11:20 -0800 <dan_bernstein> Fri. NYT xword sports reclue:  "Waldorf salad ingredient" can be "Recent target of some fan trolling during Mardi Gras."  Five letters.  Go.
1499854325690126345 2022-03-04 13:08:31 -0800 <avamae822> going to target w a list of stuff that i absolutely do not need &gt;&gt;&gt;
1499853643654303748 2022-03-04 13:05:49 -0800 <azaan786> @ramsha_mir Yes please excuse us shias for getting slaughtered every month . We only being target all over pakistan and being called kafir, so we getting killed is masses and should still say nothing. My apologies.
1499849796588380160 2022-03-04 12:50:32 -0800 <SheBangz> This man in target is nuts 😭
1499846822247944194 2022-03-04 12:38:42 -0800 <alyssajaneth> @danabeeeeeee Girl return it to target and get another ugly ass deer sweater. I’m glad your vagina is pristine ❤️
1499840640221425675 2022-03-04 12:14:08 -0800 <SidneyReilly0> It’s amazing how in 2 years of lockdown I went from global traveling and showing no fear of third world countries alone to being scared to go across the street to Target.
1499839435998961667 2022-03-04 12:09:21 -0800 <tinymira> @finelineaquaria once a couple of friends visited from ireland and they were like "we wanted the american experience but couldn't find a walmart :/" so they went to target, the dollar store, and a thrift shop and I told them walmart is the median
1499837643248607234 2022-03-04 12:02:14 -0800 <c__verly> It's past time for a no fly zone over Ukraine.   The world either stops Putin now, or we watch him destroy Ukraine and move on to the next target. While China decides it can take Taiwan and Hong Kong. And free nations succumb to authoritarians.
1499836621105123336 2022-03-04 11:58:10 -0800 <ImperialLuis1> @NeicyyT Millionaires mostly. Corporations have separate agendas than their owners or former owners. Target the companies.
1499833355310972935 2022-03-04 11:45:12 -0800 <CurtellWilson> ion really want no chick without work experience. Even if i bring in enough money i still wanna know that the woman who eyes be rolling in her head still know how to go work at target for holidays
1499833031288184840 2022-03-04 11:43:54 -0800 <AlexanderBellas> @carlbildt @NATO There is no reason for Sweden to join Nato other than to become a potential target for Russia.
1499832251827339269 2022-03-04 11:40:49 -0800 <bmarr2008> @aldin_ww @IntelCrab Now if some drones with Ukrainian markings just happen to take off from Poland and target the Russians….  Anyone country can play the false flag game, it is not exclusively a Russian game.
1499823451955240960 2022-03-04 11:05:50 -0800 <donniebryantjr> You can try a similar approach in your emails.  New [Change in Status Quo] Will Be a Disaster for [Target Audience]  Or, if a positive approach is more appropriate...  New [Change in Status Quo] Will Be A HUGE Win for [Target Audience]

Any plan to address #ClimateEmergency is minimal.  I have a bad headache now &amp; need to lie down - can anyone help checking campaign websites?
1499818929358872583 2022-03-04 10:47:52 -0800 <JohnnyBears19> Also I’m not too sure about the idea of breaking the bank for JC Jackson if I’m the Bears. Spend the money on offense and we’ll need to extend Jaylon possibly next offseason. Realistically I’d be super excited if we got him but maybe target a guy like Charvarius Ward instead
1499818065210527750 2022-03-04 10:44:26 -0800 <MichelleR1161> @MikeBuresh Walking thru target yesterday and all the little kids loudly exclaiming “He is supposed to have a mask on!” + “She doesn’t have a mask!” 😆💗
1499815815482327043 2022-03-04 10:35:30 -0800 <McgloinMia> @BJenningsEdTech @LifeIntheRegion @JonOwen1 Yes! Target just started selling popcorn and it brought back a childhood memory of Venture.
1499814271273902086 2022-03-04 10:29:22 -0800 <Kyle_B_Craig> Familiarize yourself with common structures/organization of articles in your target journal, for example if they typically include long discussions of theory, methods, history, etc.
1499813754606870528 2022-03-04 10:27:18 -0800 <AmplifiedK> @javitagracia @diannaeanderson Many women get breast reductions to feel better &amp; many women choose breast removal as a proactive medical procedure. They target groups they simply don’t understand b/c they have been told to hate them by fascists and the corrupt religious right sipping from a poisoned well.
1499813729826967553 2022-03-04 10:27:13 -0800 <ohknai> @JTFVR @IGN Yes being a majority owner of Hulu doesn’t mean both services offer the same content, as they have different target audiences and services. Won’t be surprised when Disney does buy the rest of the shares tho
1499810831269253129 2022-03-04 10:15:41 -0800 <PoliticalNetwrk> @ChuckCallesto They always go crazy WHEN YOU'RE DIRECTLY OVER THE TARGET! 🎯💯
1499808358278352897 2022-03-04 10:05:52 -0800 <itsvijen> I love Chicago.  10 Chicagoans took a risk on me as we built Pressbox.  Now, 100 folks from the midwest are taking a risk on me as we build The 81 Collection.  We're somehow 75% full on our initial target in just 11 weeks.  LFG!
1499807511049912334 2022-03-04 10:02:30 -0800 <iTz_KEYO> @BullishRippers APPLE, MICROSOFT, TESLA, TARGET, And VOO(etf).  Small starter positions in F, Sofi &amp; PLTR.
1499806123058212864 2022-03-04 09:56:59 -0800 <ally_bae> Yo why the fuck does @Target have a tights and hosiery section if they haven’t had tights or hosiery since 2019?
1499805405421125635 2022-03-04 09:54:08 -0800 <meowlabelle> The man done worn nail polish and wigs and all sorts of character fits on his profiles this whole time  Yall wasnt even tuned in. And it shows. Unseen yesterday, target today. Over socks!!!!  SOCKS!
1499802739055935499 2022-03-04 09:43:32 -0800 <slldney> @JamicanBanana man its just respect i dont even target ban anymore
1499802053014700037 2022-03-04 09:40:49 -0800 <Dumily_Chambers> @enterc1evername It was only a Target bra. It cost like $7 and is made from dryer sheets.
1499800004579450888 2022-03-04 09:32:40 -0800 <T_noco_Cain> @coldestwinters Target Walmart be having oster for like $25
1499797620017045514 2022-03-04 09:23:12 -0800 <ktswift12> @pzlabellarte Exactly my issue. I found ones I liked from target for $160 *each* and they have terrible reviews. Pass.
1499796447621009408 2022-03-04 09:18:32 -0800 <Senselessed> @qprjohn121 @ABarbashin @PjotrSauer Using software you already paid for, such as older versions of Office that were one time licenses, will still work. Using Word, Powerpoint, Excel, aren't what people are worried about. SQL Server being that old, is an open target on cyber attacks. But these are barely 1/2
1499796278221455363 2022-03-04 09:17:52 -0800 <Sean_nanigans> @KharloKong Maybe I missed the part where she bragged because I thought she said she found it difficult but also felt she had to since Pangina was sending strong girls home and she felt she’d have a target on her back now that she had a win
1499794180335308803 2022-03-04 09:09:32 -0800 <tmj_IL_pharm> Don't be shy. Score a job like "Pharmacy Technician- Target Store" at CVS Health by asking for referrals. It's a great way to get a meeting with HR. Check out the link in our bio to apply. #cvspharmtech #pharmtech
1499790458029019136 2022-03-04 08:54:44 -0800 <pepperdove> @mooyah0325 @heebvnnies @inkigayosv2 Here in US they are like 15-30 dollars but you almost always have to pay lots of shipping. There’s a store in the mall by me that has lots of kpop stuff though and they have albums there to buy IRL, and ODDINARY is going to be at Target for $24 I think?
1499789878028120075 2022-03-04 08:52:26 -0800 <DPoseB4L> @Exquisite_M3 They party wings the best too..I never used to shop for food at target
1499789328112836610 2022-03-04 08:50:15 -0800 <STGhee> @MxRJ611 @CTULocal1 It seems like this rule is being used to target a very specific person.
1499787333008343044 2022-03-04 08:42:19 -0800 <psychojoe> Unpopular opinion: @amazon  Lost Ark players are disgruntled @ATVI_AB WoW Outlaw rogues who still haven't been given a reason for their target cap in AoE.  @Microsoft
1499787187591729166 2022-03-04 08:41:44 -0800 <salkken> @hatebreed25 @shayneoray None of this is true.  Israel only operates in self-defense. PA doesn't want peace because that would elevate Israel's international standing. So it pays terrorist suicide bombers' families. IDF doesn't target civilians.
1499785712698376193 2022-03-04 08:35:53 -0800 <NAEEMALEXANDER> @vanidosa27 @Target That don't make no sense; for him to be that inconsiderate and unprofessional.
1499784856322068490 2022-03-04 08:32:29 -0800 <Exquisite_M3> Ngl target got some of the best turkey bacon if not thee best
1499783006072057864 2022-03-04 08:25:07 -0800 <DanielleSATM> I had to fill out target demographics for a convention application today and instead of writing what I did, I should have just written: Not Sam Elliott.
1499781798934495234 2022-03-04 08:20:20 -0800 <TuYutes> @Ihartitz He’s 27 I think…Jerry-world fell in love with multi (8) sub 4.4 wr 40’s. AC flight ✈️ to ORD next for JF to have a #1 target?
1499781004021710850 2022-03-04 08:17:10 -0800 <ItsBenBlanks> This will not reach the target demo
1499780829027106818 2022-03-04 08:16:28 -0800 <PS_LoveJas> @_SignedRomance You see why we stick to Target
1499773952004087815 2022-03-04 07:49:09 -0800 <duncankime> @CivMilAir I’d say “Flak? Over Target!”

1499767347254644739 2022-03-04 07:22:54 -0800 <keychung> @ThatEricAlper The Tick (both versions) Human Target Firefly Thundarr the Barbarian
1499766002682318862 2022-03-04 07:17:34 -0800 <curtisabradley> Moreover, a third state's military might become a lawful target even if just providing arms. If the U.S. drove a truckload of missiles into Ukraine, Russian soldiers would presumably have combatant immunity when targeting the truck, even if that meant U.S. casualties. 5/6
1499766001545748484 2022-03-04 07:17:33 -0800 <curtisabradley> Lawful targets for this purpose will include the military assets of both the target state and those of its co-belligerents. If the U.S. began bombing operations against Russian forces in Ukraine, the U.S. planes would become lawful targets for purposes of combatant immunity. 4/6
1499765999280828419 2022-03-04 07:17:33 -0800 <curtisabradley> The claim is that, because it is illegal under the Charter to use non-defensive force vs. another state, if a state does so, it is also precluded from using force against other states that are assisting the target state. If so, that allegedly makes co-belligerency irrelevant. 2/6
1499764748048547851 2022-03-04 07:12:34 -0800 <AlbertoCotto> @majordouzie Ok so Target has these fleece sweatpants that have no business being as nice as they are - the comfort! I'd def check them out, especially if you're in a time crutch
1499764449204260867 2022-03-04 07:11:23 -0800 <fairleft> @CleetusOlney No, the original tweet accurately says the Ukrainians RETREATED into the nuke plant. That almost implies they were NOT the aggressors.  And nothing dangerous occurred. Maybe people with even minimum common sense are careful in that situation about where they target their weapons.
1499764401771102211 2022-03-04 07:11:12 -0800 <salkken> @hatebreed25 @shayneoray @benshapiro Israel only operates in self-defense. This "both sides" argument absolves the terrorist instigator of its war crime of targeting civilians. Israel doesn't target civilians. It targets the Hamas terrorists in charge of the rocket attacks.
1499760081893740550 2022-03-04 06:54:02 -0800 <niccinikki_> I just woke up and I’m trying to go to Target 💓 been thinking about this for two days now.
1499758445771333642 2022-03-04 06:47:32 -0800 <QTheGreatOne87> @WorldWideWob It’s cool to show Russ. Easy target, I get it. But to never show how Lebron doesn’t rotate on defense or box out makes these post irrelevant. People need to stop scapegoating Russ. The whole team trash
1499747765089415169 2022-03-04 06:05:05 -0800 <harrykingholmes> Niching down is important because if you’re target market is too broad…  One, it’ll be hard to find these high ticket clients. Two, if they find you they won’t view you as a solution to their problem.
1499747743560048649 2022-03-04 06:05:00 -0800 <levnaginsky> @matttillotson Old navy and Target has pretty decent workout clothes. I bought some of their shirts for $7-8/each and they’ve held up well through numerous washes.
1499737745253613576 2022-03-04 05:25:16 -0800 <mrsinger186> @brettturner57 @BrendaWestcott2 @POTUS I’d love to. I’m so sure, you can use me as a target and I’m sure I’ll be fine.
1499737711988686867 2022-03-04 05:25:08 -0800 <ProMarket_org> The influence of oligarchs may be over-estimated, so Zucman proposes a systematic approach to target the wealthiest 10,000 to 20,000 Russians, "those who’ve most benefitted from Putin’s rule.”
1499737588533497860 2022-03-04 05:24:39 -0800 <jason_j_g> @champwebdotnet @scottdixon9 @CGRTeams True story: last night i had a dream i was roller blading inside a vacant Target store and I got yelled at by @scottdixon9 because I wasn’t using the racing line. 😂
1499726964520800264 2022-03-04 04:42:26 -0800 <BrianEck85> Local Target and Best Buy has sold out Triangle Strategy. I probably should have preordered it. Looks like I’ll have to take a trip to a nearby Best Buy out of the the city after work. This might be a good indication that the game sells well. Better then Octopath Traveler?
1499723291182788609 2022-03-04 04:27:50 -0800 <Seburakku> Target pasarnya bukan kamu berarti min
1499712487343669254 2022-03-04 03:44:54 -0800 <chelleda0ne> @JermaineJupiter One of my coworkers did this and two other ones told upper management and essentially she ended with a “target” on her back. But good thing man never has the final say. She got her a offer and is now on to bigger/better 🙌🏾.
1499667413545234435 2022-03-04 00:45:48 -0800 <optimist_press> @FPWellman @GovRonDeSantis The powers that be want to make it so that callous ingrates with little dicks feel vindicated when they target people who wear masks for political violence.
1499650477570539523 2022-03-03 23:38:30 -0800 <abdallaha92> @KyleWOrton I wouldn't categorize the Pantsir-S1 bayraktar target practice as "the good stuff". The expensive stuff, sure. But there ain't much good about it
1499640085758812161 2022-03-03 22:57:13 -0800 <aflyax> @ClintEhrlich this is shit analysis. they sent soldiers to conquer it because it's a strategic target and Ukrainian soldiers are there. they are still shooting at it like the utter morons they are.
1499635850153443332 2022-03-03 22:40:23 -0800 <111th_n_Homan> @BuzzPatterson NYC aid the target, always has been.
1499627149036240899 2022-03-03 22:05:48 -0800 <THEmosesjoseph> @MarcosjRod Yea. By shooting innocent people that aren’t involved and having a shoot out where others not involved could’ve got hurt. Nothing says “I am standing up for my family” more than that 😒 oh and not even hitting the intended target with the 5 shots (at least) taken. #dumb
1499622358394540035 2022-03-03 21:46:46 -0800 <poptartsd> @EricAllixRogers I hope it's ok, too! I once saw one in the Addison St. Target's parking lot at 10pm, trying to hide in the bushes. My dog was in the car and acted all nbd but I was SO STOKED.
1499610892421509120 2022-03-03 21:01:12 -0800 <gameism> @estellatse @alexqgb It’s impossible to pick a favorite. This is a target rich environment.
1499610376987713537 2022-03-03 20:59:09 -0800 <DNBurner> @monsieurmoscato Dropped to my knees in the middle of target 😭
1499605813991821316 2022-03-03 20:41:02 -0800 <crosstawk> Honestly, I am NOT in the target demo for Elden Ring. I dropped off Bloodborne in like 15min. But there was enough good stuff here to keep me engaged for 15hrs. That's something. For the kind of person these games are aimed at, it's gotta be something special.
1499605807398273026 2022-03-03 20:41:00 -0800 <EADeBellis> @DemsInArray @lxeagle17 @PoliticalKiwi Yeah, my prior is in a general election: Cuellar &gt; generic D &gt; Cisneros  It makes sense for Justice Dems to target TX-28. Low-turnout primaries are the only ones they win, but that's a *really* bad district to run on, basically, campus politics.
1499604575245983767 2022-03-03 20:36:06 -0800 <mosoutherngirl1> @DannieD01 @Fedup270 No I’m target everyday 3x Cancer patient. I need support and and a cure.
1499601859971104769 2022-03-03 20:25:19 -0800 <AMERICANOW7> @AlwaysRightUSA And finally, the mere fact that the illegitimate president use his name so often and couldn’t use trumps, just because he is there a target of hate, even if he’s not really who they say he is, we know now not to believe anything MSM says.We cannot on see, that which we have seen

1499559962149892098 2022-03-03 17:38:50 -0800 <JohnCDehn> @joncoopertweets To be completely fair, some may very well be being lied to about the nature of the targets they are engaging, especially if they are artillery or rocket artillery (far away from the target).
1499559603650109447 2022-03-03 17:37:24 -0800 <momentsnotcards> @TheFFOracle @NFLALLDAY Isn’t that kind of the target EV for collectors? Can’t be +EV or else market is all flippers

1499556113850806283 2022-03-03 17:23:32 -0800 <divineorder07> @sjs856 💯.  Or changing the rules and moving the target. 👍🏾

You walk out of there like its day time in Vegas questioning everything lol and by everything, I mean everything in your cart lol id love to know what the percentage of people that walk in there for only one thing and come out with that one thing lol
1499533366860857344 2022-03-03 15:53:09 -0800 <alleeeysooon> Anxious in target per usual and this guys sweatshirt says go fast don’t die and I just want to know how he’s reading my brain
1499531737885515781 2022-03-03 15:46:40 -0800 <in_sithirlind> @j_breidnbach it’s so weird. every target.
1499529557875036160 2022-03-03 15:38:01 -0800 <RobertAKoch001> @amcatanzaro @RadioFreeTom I guess our area was so target rich they figured why bother?
1499523584267624456 2022-03-03 15:14:16 -0800 <IsaLeeWolf> Like a "Benedict Arnold" is a traitor,  a "putin"  should forever be a coward.  Strong, brave leaders target hearts and minds.  Not hospitals and kindergartens.
1499520927599521793 2022-03-03 15:03:43 -0800 <christinarose33> I am 100% considering my target run to get booze and snacks my workout today. 👌🏻 Those groceries weren’t going to carry themselves!
1499518141889761287 2022-03-03 14:52:39 -0800 <gotpinkbtchh> @cr0issantitties Yeah I love target ones too but I want better ones
1499515056949764099 2022-03-03 14:40:23 -0800 <steelydamnnn> Yo, slime is really good for anxiety, holy shit. I just zoned out in my car in the target parking lot with this shit.
1499512864410935300 2022-03-03 14:31:41 -0800 <cr0issantitties> @gotpinkbtchh Tbh my target ones 😭😭

They are all either owned by #BigPharma and our #ForProfitHealthcareIndustry or they are trying to ingratiate themselves with members of Congress/Senate who are.
1499501059441668096 2022-03-03 13:44:46 -0800 <crosberg> @LelandGoodman Of course!  It's one of those "you don't know what you don't know" things, so having at least some fundamentals down will absolutely help you get to a specific target down the line.  It's a lot like learning a new language!
1499498529609469961 2022-03-03 13:34:43 -0800 <dominick1944> @dcfairbank @RoKhanna @J_ManPrime21 @jimmy_dore @miserablelib @SusanSarandon @RepRoKhanna @SenWarren @Walmart @Target @DollarTree @kroger @MarianosMarket @jewelosco @McDonalds @cvspharmacy @Walgreens @TheDemocrats @GOP @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris @SenSchumer @SenatorWarnock @ossoff @demswatchdog @ewarren Politicians making promises and plans will not change how our healthcare system functions. They must pass laws to do this.
1499494187909226505 2022-03-03 13:17:28 -0800 <Xanthos24> @BigToneTrader @ItsJamieButNice @ChongLiMMA2 You can’t do what Cain did. Period. You get the intended target. If he did all this to just 1 person, I’d be like cool he got what he had coming. This ain’t it.
1499493946510172161 2022-03-03 13:16:30 -0800 <therealpmoneyy> Not starbucks in target couldnt make blended drinks☹️
1499491038032969732 2022-03-03 13:04:57 -0800 <iamBrandonTV> @_omgigi_ @theemisstoto @KummKunt It’s from target nothing special lol
1499488615956684803 2022-03-03 12:55:19 -0800 <redux_lint> Honestly my work got so much better when I realized the haters were my target audience
1499488341472993284 2022-03-03 12:54:14 -0800 <donnafreedman_> i went to target finally and hardly spent a buck im so proud of myself 🥲
1499484536366903297 2022-03-03 12:39:07 -0800 <iamBrandonTV> @theemisstoto You should have seen me at target looking for the right frame hehe.
1499481808957804548 2022-03-03 12:28:16 -0800 <Gina25416396> @DrRadchenko Very much on target.
1499481440844759046 2022-03-03 12:26:49 -0800 <callmepagie> there's just certain parts of target I gotta avoid
1499478875629404160 2022-03-03 12:16:37 -0800 <ryanweidenaar> @Sci_FactChecker @keith_currie @avalaina some people are using them as bomb shelters and cover as one would expect russia not to target these things
1499478025196482562 2022-03-03 12:13:14 -0800 <dcfairbank> @RoKhanna @J_ManPrime21 @jimmy_dore @miserablelib @SusanSarandon @RepRoKhanna @SenWarren @Walmart @Target @DollarTree @kroger @MarianosMarket @jewelosco @McDonalds @cvspharmacy @Walgreens The economic pain faced by the American #WorkingClass was not necessary.  It did not have to happen.  Other developed countries covered payroll and protected their citizens.  Both @TheDemocrats and @GOP have failed us. #COVID19 exposed the rot at the core of the American empire.
1499476361949421568 2022-03-03 12:06:38 -0800 <dcfairbank> @RoKhanna @J_ManPrime21 @jimmy_dore @miserablelib @SusanSarandon @RepRoKhanna @SenWarren I've spoken to workers at @Walmart @Target @DollarTree @kroger @MarianosMarket @jewelosco @McDonalds @cvspharmacy @Walgreens during #COVID19.  They were deemed #FrontlineHeroes but have been given squat in return for their sacrifices, not even a #LivingWage. #DisposableHeroes
1499474733498306570 2022-03-03 12:00:10 -0800 <ShanuMathew93> Next-gen = connected packaging: the ability to track the package through the value chain and would allow the consumer to be connected to [loyalty programs] but also allow brand owners to track package movements &amp; understand consumer behavior to better target marketing
1499474145553399815 2022-03-03 11:57:49 -0800 <2davion1g> Don’t Nobody Say Shít To Me Walmart &amp; Target Den Got Expensive Asf
1499470077795651585 2022-03-03 11:41:40 -0800 <ShaunRocksX> @CryptoCapo_ That’s my target as well ;)
1499465953511411715 2022-03-03 11:25:16 -0800 <mueller1279> @LePapillonBlu2 Hi Mayra. I'm sorry that people seem to target you. I have no idea why they would. You're amazing! Try not to let them get you down. 💙💛
1499465071642165255 2022-03-03 11:21:46 -0800 <Tom__Pappalardo> @Gregory_Pecked Isnt it a bit psychotic being amped for war while working in DC and knowing DC is probably a target for a nuke at some early point in said war. I presume there are not enough bunkers in DC for all those in power that will want to scurry to one when the shit hits the fan.
1499464740535517189 2022-03-03 11:20:27 -0800 <fakejeansmith> When I was younger I always wanted to work at target and them mfs would never hire me
1499463192262725640 2022-03-03 11:14:18 -0800 <wilestrada1> @apebayc Jeans from Target. Shirt from Walmart. Lfg
1499462907196841993 2022-03-03 11:13:10 -0800 <J_B_Horne> S&amp;P 500's best performers so far this week: Occidental Petroleum $OXY +25%  Kroger $KR +18% Best Buy $BBY +17%  Target $TGT +14%  APA Corp. $APA +13%
1499459124119183369 2022-03-03 10:58:08 -0800 <ShanuMathew93> TARGETS:  -Of the organizations that disclosed at least one type of emissions reduction target, only 4,510 (less than 35%) disclosed credible targets.  -Only 6% of organizations fully disclosed details of their net-zero targets.
1499455144232116224 2022-03-03 10:42:19 -0800 <1morequestion99> @Lincolnletter @CBSEveningNews His conduct was way over the top.  I didn’t know how reckless he was until I heard him testify.  Who the hell discharges a weapon without having a clear shot at a target?
1499452652542840843 2022-03-03 10:32:25 -0800 <PhillipGarland> That man Franklin gotta target on his back.
1499446257219256329 2022-03-03 10:07:00 -0800 <IsaLeeWolf> @KyivIndependent I hope they hold but I don't trust putin.  He also said he wouldn't target civilians and didn't target civilians.  Thank you for your diligent reporting.
1499446254056751111 2022-03-03 10:06:59 -0800 <GramGoesToRehab> Target raising their wages is baller cause it will get others to also raise their wages to compete I hope
1499441711294078979 2022-03-03 09:48:56 -0800 <samaracvdd> ditched school to go eat wendy’s in the target parking lot
1499440758750863366 2022-03-03 09:45:09 -0800 <MakeHimSay_A> @_ccb94 Very much so! And people are also uncultured. For your caliber of work &amp; your artistry, you’re dead ass meant to be in Milan or some shit. Hollywood at the least. That’s your target audience.. they don’t appreciate that here.
1499440404969791491 2022-03-03 09:43:45 -0800 <WinningSolo> @shannonahouston @PRisUs Have you identified your target / dream client, Shannon?  Whether as an avatar or a specific list of names, it can help you determine the best way to put yourself in front of them.  #FreelanceChat
1499438772496179210 2022-03-03 09:37:16 -0800 <Daedalusx007> @LSotek Actually that seems like a fairly mundane visit to Walmart, but a positively mortifying trip to Target.
1499438748601401353 2022-03-03 09:37:10 -0800 <NickyGsCards> @madteachcards Sometimes you just gotta scratch that itch. I got a hanger from Target last week lol
1499435195254063107 2022-03-03 09:23:03 -0800 <Chisportsnut> @AdamHoge Predictions sure to go wrong  This will be a moving target of change
1499432526271635461 2022-03-03 09:12:27 -0800 <ladyfey12> @NotEnoughHough @raggyrag72 No it’s a good mix of computer bots and human trolls who’s only purpose is to pimp a single message to a target audience over and over again.
1499431082722222091 2022-03-03 09:06:42 -0800 <lance_silvano> Might fuck around and Pass Gas in The Granola Bar Aisle inside of Target.
1499430011723554819 2022-03-03 09:02:27 -0800 <AveDeFuego29> @TNTerens @BrianSandalow @ChicagoFire You guys know the questions that a lot of us have in our minds 😌. Seems like we missed on a U-22 target recently; are we expecting any signings in the coming weeks? Particularly at the wing? Any potential within the league or TAM signings? Thank you for your dedication to #cf97
1499420976366243840 2022-03-03 08:26:33 -0800 <egoscrossing> First day off in like, 2 weeks that I actually have to myself 👀 so I’m gonna do chores and bake but first, a trip to target 🥲💕
1499420854614204419 2022-03-03 08:26:04 -0800 <bonushellboy> the way $8 body wash from Target is doing a better job... just doesn't seem right. topsy turns logic
1499419183767031809 2022-03-03 08:19:25 -0800 <talkingnewmedia> @JoyceWhiteVance Of course Stone will be a target, he was a target for Mueller, as well. But the DOJ playbook is to indict the non-politicians. Mueller did it, and Garland is following the policy. Trump, apparently, has nothing to worry about as long as Garland is AG.
1499416163490611212 2022-03-03 08:07:25 -0800 <chicagocu> @CWBChicago Never ever fall asleep.  You’re a target if you do.
1499416132578643969 2022-03-03 08:07:18 -0800 <ReallyBars> @BrooklynsOwn90 I’ve been saying to some people on here and on IG: imagine buying a Walmart DAO, Target Token or a CIA coin and thinking it’s a good investment 😂😂😂
1499415249660821504 2022-03-03 08:03:47 -0800 <tapruden> #istandwithrussia is a perfect target for #BTSARMY
1499409514231214088 2022-03-03 07:41:00 -0800 <milo2120> @jp23758622 Diamond charmander and vaporeon   Target dropped the ball big time
1499408467848794121 2022-03-03 07:36:51 -0800 <CoachBruce_TDT> Everything that has been heard is Poles, being a former offensive lineman, will target that position in the #NFLDraft #ThirdDownThursdays
1499405586588479491 2022-03-03 07:25:24 -0800 <FF_Kollar> I feel like we’re missing something big with the “targets are earned” cliche that gets thrown around. Targets are earned, but the value we place on earning those targets should be weighted by the quality of the target competition around the player earning targets imo
1499401692948750343 2022-03-03 07:09:55 -0800 <Joelabrodsky> @chipfranklin Right, Russian security service, the same people that murder on Putin’s orders, have now betrayed him by foiling a hit on his #1 target. Why does this seem like a highly dubious claim? Why do you accept any reports that you like &amp; report them as fact?
1499388480882982916 2022-03-03 06:17:25 -0800 <PUGStockMarket> Looks like the $SPX will open 30 points above the 4389 IHS neckline.   Closing above this neckline today triggers the 4663 measured move IHS target.
1499387892501782533 2022-03-03 06:15:05 -0800 <ASpankoNews> And look: I ran a trade pub for four years, part of the gig is giving red meat to your target audience. I wrote headlines and framed stories in ways I wouldn't anymore, and nobody can criticize me harder than myself. But this is wildly off base on so many levels
1499387243819114500 2022-03-03 06:12:30 -0800 <ChrisBuccola> @MalcolmNance Is this convoy too far behind the lines to send the SU-25s in ?  I know air superiority hasn't be achieved it just seems like such a juicy target.     Getting Highway of Death vibes.
1499382186868449283 2022-03-03 05:52:25 -0800 <LPWildcat> @Bat_Yann Oh once all this settles down let the Ukrainian navy use it for target practice perhaps.
1499380156015730696 2022-03-03 05:44:20 -0800 <KchimistryFP> @relz29 @Rap_student101 @SaycheeseDGTL That boy is on his way to jail again 😂 he is a real life goofy no cap 😂 remember when he was laughing at nba it’s finna be his turn 😂 that nigga still on trail 😂 n on top of that he making himself a target. Too late for that positive shit 😂
1499377014263975942 2022-03-03 05:31:51 -0800 <jasonmuelver> @BandyXLee1 Yet one of the first things called upon in an I telligence vriefing of a subject/target is an psychological evaluation.   So maybe, where it really counts, your work is essential!!
1499376726924738562 2022-03-03 05:30:43 -0800 <David_Gunkel> @rodakker Correct. The problem of using one moving target to define and benchmark another moving target.
1499372570260484098 2022-03-03 05:14:12 -0800 <donnafreedman_> i wanna go to target
1499357701385641988 2022-03-03 04:15:07 -0800 <bgregory102> @DrMajeski @CourageousCPN @BlythCPN The cat and jack brand from target has adaptive clothing! The best part- they look just the same as the non-adaptive clothing.
1499344907932258304 2022-03-03 03:24:17 -0800 <TheSpanishDrunk> @GiveEmHellLMM @savagebard @Shannon_A_IL Really because our mask mandate was just lifted and between jewel and target and pet supplies plus 95% of people weren’t wearing a mask.
1499301203339104264 2022-03-03 00:30:37 -0800 <boingboingjuice> @Orwells_Ghost_ people have a Ai psychological profile and don't know it, it takes all your likes dislikes and what you look at build a profile and then target you with propaganda to convince you to think a certain way to hack your brain
1499285628298616833 2022-03-02 23:28:43 -0800 <sunshinechi1> @TuttieNambela 😂😂😂 I got it online from Target 😊
1499277431550758912 2022-03-02 22:56:09 -0800 <JillWineBanks> @sheshechic I'm with @MalcolmNance. Consulted him before going out of my area of expertise to question why nothing has been done to the obvious target of a 40 mile long convoy of tanks heading to damage Kyiev, a city I know, having worked there for Motorola.
1499277225115496453 2022-03-02 22:55:20 -0800 <coquito_papiii> @fl33tw00dbigmac Yea! I used to get them at Target all the time!
1499258914847739907 2022-03-02 21:42:34 -0800 <goodiedaman> @AmyJacobson @GovPritzker @MorningAnswer @DanProft Feds just don't talk to people.  You're either a Target, Witness or Subject.  Feds also don't "clear" people of wrong-doing.  It just might mean they don't have evidence to indict you.
1499253671959347204 2022-03-02 21:21:44 -0800 <BearDown5434> @Ericmanynumbers @austinblair116 @JAYSINNLAMAR @y_akopov @EliotHiggins I think that’s accurate, especially taking into account Russian willingness to intentionally target and kill civilians (not to mention their history of besieging &amp; starving cities).
1499251909802217474 2022-03-02 21:14:44 -0800 <brigidkeely> I was looking at some clothing on Target and that reminded me I need to get something for myself and I opened up torrid's website and experienced whiplash from seeing, like, fat bodies. WHERE DID ALL THESE FAT CHICKS COME FROM? my brain screamed. Oh yeah. It's a fat website.
1499242536610766851 2022-03-02 20:37:29 -0800 <JLawnicki93> @ItsWillCarmack @survivorcbs So you became what you hate. Target and remove all white people out of the game first because you think thats what they've done for the last 40 seasons. So do the same thing ?
1499242213431291905 2022-03-02 20:36:12 -0800 <Staarkyy> Stream was really good! Got our target Shiny Quilava and a Shiny Spiritomb the next Instance. We keep grinding raided the legend @Poijz,  see you all tomorrow!
1499240454428114946 2022-03-02 20:29:13 -0800 <awadihmud03> @BasicallyIDoWrk Imma start working at target since they paying 24 and hour. I’ll send you one when I get an extra
1499239012065693702 2022-03-02 20:23:29 -0800 <gameism> @technosucks @Halo @HaloGoldblum She's right though.  [Pick up Overshield] [Immediately one-shot]  Why the FUCK didn't it turn on? I just ran through hellfire to get it after you painted a fucking target on it for everyone to come to it.  [F]
1499237427772276739 2022-03-02 20:17:11 -0800 <germsies> I fucked up and didn’t get ice cream while I was in Target
1499235331861843968 2022-03-02 20:08:52 -0800 <randy_haggins> @elizam2016cityx Sorry if I ruined you night Gina 🙏🥺 I shouldn't of let him make me that upset but I've been ignoring him for awhile and he must think I'm a easy target he forgot I'm from Chicago too Sorry again my friend 🙏♥️
1499232593937678338 2022-03-02 19:57:59 -0800 <jrvxo_> the fact that i live less than 5 mins away from target is actually dangerous
1499230273594081284 2022-03-02 19:48:46 -0800 <ShebaBabbyy> Jr Favorite Store Is Target Now 🙄
1499229817299947528 2022-03-02 19:46:57 -0800 <SouthSideSisco> @EmmanuelAcho Probably the best division in the NFL though. Unless you are going to hire Belichick, Reid, or Tomlin you won’t really find a better coach that is available. Since you think they shouldn’t extend him who do you think they should target as a replacement?
1499229011565813762 2022-03-02 19:43:45 -0800 <FreeBandzKenya> I Just Love Target Shower Curtains ☺️❤️
1499223971434311682 2022-03-02 19:23:43 -0800 <Raymond3414> @lelbrett The good thing is I live close to a Target. The bad thing is that live by a Target and that's wifey's oasis 🤦🏽
1499221286538694659 2022-03-02 19:13:03 -0800 <DontKillMyVibe_> I need to stay out of target. This is ridiculous
1499219752945864709 2022-03-02 19:06:57 -0800 <EpicJeffTime> @iambrianprince @lessphiling @Target They have really nailed drive up. The only place to get it right.
1499217229778493443 2022-03-02 18:56:56 -0800 <LuckeeLefty11> @MariahAminah @CariJayyHair I bought some from target for $5 lol
1499216962446049281 2022-03-02 18:55:52 -0800 <CatrionaMDW> @davemckinney The government can lie to you. He could be a target. If the moron @JBPritzker talked to the Feds without a lawyer present he really is dumb as a box of rocks.
1499216546509512711 2022-03-02 18:54:13 -0800 <LaurelLeavy> @FalpalsChoice 💕…I’ll have more , please !!! Hope Target USA has them ~ I’ll let you know next time I go … 💞🎶🕺🏻🍀🛌
1499215697460985856 2022-03-02 18:50:51 -0800 <KM_TheKing> That’s great Biden wants to stop ads targeting children but when will he ban ads that target big dumb dumbs like me?
1499210940931317763 2022-03-02 18:31:56 -0800 <ReallyRemona> @PrettyMisses08 Right! Because half the mess I get just because it’s a $1. I’d rather shop the &amp;3/$5 stuff at target. It’s a better quality.
1499206641807499269 2022-03-02 18:14:51 -0800 <OriginalRymo> @gnoble79 @jimcramer “Underweight” yet a higher price target than current levels.
1499206289989279748 2022-03-02 18:13:28 -0800 <djIsLucid> Day 29 #100DaysOfHacking,#BugBounty - Looked at a program that is less then 4 months old with only two bugs discovered on the target. There was about 100 unique live web servers on the target and in around two hours I was able to wrap my head around their infrastructure and
1499205855048343553 2022-03-02 18:11:44 -0800 <Just__RoRo> Target starting pay is going to $24 Verizon they coming for y’all lol
1499203869452214277 2022-03-02 18:03:50 -0800 <MrScalper420> @DisTrackers They blocked me because I told them they were late announcing target releases... that guys has an issue
1499203101512896519 2022-03-02 18:00:47 -0800 <Casper13692> @WILLBADOT Shock 😲  Stopped into Target, they had them, mostly long leg or boxer style
1499202137401798661 2022-03-02 17:56:58 -0800 <vero2166> Gotta go to target and get some necessities not feeling today at all
1499201863043985411 2022-03-02 17:55:52 -0800 <tardytrtl> @emptywheel And I don't walk into Target intending to spend $100, but here we are.
1499191353967792131 2022-03-02 17:14:07 -0800 <Secur80Consult> @VDomeraski @zackbeauchamp Exactly. I lived very near their # 1 target for most of the last 2 decades of the Cold War. Then trained for it in the military. I'm over it.
1499190758921932801 2022-03-02 17:11:45 -0800 <changingmanchi> @Notasheep1832 @HillCountree @guypbenson What’s the bill then ? Who does it target?
1499189932488904709 2022-03-02 17:08:28 -0800 <FlorenceOfLabia> He did this at great personal cost, becoming the target of attack from his detractors who think hate speech is okay. But in the end, he alone changed their minds. The moral of the story is, even when you’re 14, your voice matters. Use it. Allyship is important. #proudmama #pride
1499183368063401985 2022-03-02 16:42:23 -0800 <samiam123____> Felt like shit after my run so I went to target, bought some candles and got Starbucks right afterwards. So basic bitch of me but 1000% worked.
1499182615219392512 2022-03-02 16:39:23 -0800 <_jamienicole7> 95% of people at target right now still have masks on which seems like a higher percentage than before the mask mandate was lifted. 🧐
1499181697111363585 2022-03-02 16:35:44 -0800 <theHeart419> @KSavage03 She confused about boys and girls but her target was a girl she was checking for. She was getting dolled up cuz she wanted Lucia not cuz of a boy. Though it may look like she confused… she not, they pushing it as innocent confusion but Ashley gay. I see right through that tv bs.
1499179402659348482 2022-03-02 16:26:37 -0800 <diaryofnoire> @JoJoDancerrr I hate that Target lol
1499179373445926914 2022-03-02 16:26:30 -0800 <GreenAuditor> @ABC7 $24 sounds about right for all the  !Bullshit! 💩 from Management.  Looking at you #Target #Mayfair
1499178906053750789 2022-03-02 16:24:39 -0800 <milo2120> @DisTrackers Can they just re release the diamond charmander. You know after target did us all wrong
1499174557051146245 2022-03-02 16:07:22 -0800 <Allybearrr6> ladies, DONT go to target unless u got $ to spend the clothes for this collection are so cute 😡 target is the devil
1499172930105786370 2022-03-02 16:00:54 -0800 <HennyAndWoes> @IceColdVengence @_zbrooks @Jess81rm @ChrisDaukausMMA As much as I’d love to disagree I can’t, my brother was shot in a church only because he was hanging out with a guy who was into some shit. They shot the whole church up, hit my brother twice and another guy once, didn’t even hit the target. It’s really touchy situation tbh.
1499172093585469445 2022-03-02 15:57:35 -0800 <Uncrewed> Redistricting made this district even more of a target, going from Biden+6 to Biden+10 (mostly by adding parts of Joliet). Batinick's retiring this year and Benton's running again, making this a prime pickup opportunity.  @DrewSav @politicalpassi1
1499168066797715457 2022-03-02 15:41:34 -0800 <lintile91> @mollsrosebud you too have also influenced me to buy them next time I go to target
1499166901842452483 2022-03-02 15:36:57 -0800 <lakindsa> i have video interview with target
1499166477601148936 2022-03-02 15:35:16 -0800 <MelvinLTate> @TFroehlig It was. And now I wonder if former Chicago mayor Richard M. Daley is the feds' next target.
1499164618438103045 2022-03-02 15:27:52 -0800 <ike_gabrael> @LG_CS_lies @Aysha80273292 @TheDailyShow It really doesn’t, the human antipathy makes it easier to target people like me, because of the clear marker of difference in skin, as western society did so eloquently in their laws that marked those differences.
1499164587647811596 2022-03-02 15:27:45 -0800 <GoatHouseNFL> #Cardinals Free Agent WR Christian Kirk is expected to be a popular target in Free Agency, per @joshweinfuss.
1499158056852152321 2022-03-02 15:01:48 -0800 <Synergy1Radio> When the russians run out of ammo and they will they will be surrounded and killed by the Ukrainian's no mercy. Many will not return home on both sides why. I think NATO countries need to target cities in russia and drop missiles.
1499156769259536386 2022-03-02 14:56:41 -0800 <mikelord821> @USSportsCards1 @Target @Twitter Those $20/$100 baby purchases hit different💯
1499156225103179786 2022-03-02 14:54:31 -0800 <TraceyRyniec> @RaviDas90922857 @amazonholder1 @verge Customers actually buy more in the stores, than they do online, on average. Who hasn't gone to Target for one thing and left with 10 items a half an hour later? Lol. Dangerous.
1499147327688249346 2022-03-02 14:19:10 -0800 <veronicaeye> @URnotYRmother I saw someone say they don't deadlines, but target weeks. It's frustrating. Thanks for what you are doing for our young people.
1499145153939922957 2022-03-02 14:10:32 -0800 <1morequestion99> @Gee_McK @wvtech @CourtTV What part of “wanton endangerment” don’t you understand? That’s what he is charged with which is another name for reckless behavior.  Discharging a weapon in an location where others could be harmed without seeing a target is the quintessential definition of wanton endangerment.
1499144753748795398 2022-03-02 14:08:56 -0800 <SpotivityApp> @TheRealJRSmith @TheRealJRSmith  - Hit me up.  Your comments referenced here in your discussion with B. Marshall hit the target.  We need to talk.  I also reached out via insta.  Montana.
1499142416259067907 2022-03-02 13:59:39 -0800 <papadaca> @BeSmoove7 I'm shocked Target pays that much Walmart barely pay $8 an hour
1499142087236857858 2022-03-02 13:58:20 -0800 <1morequestion99> @wvtech @Gee_McK @CourtTV Not at all. To see a target and not be able to hit it is all together different from shooting indiscriminately at a target you can’t even see.  That’s gross negligence!
1499140983728005124 2022-03-02 13:53:57 -0800 <sox_oz> Help me decide. Will spend same amount on either. 2021 update chrome still available on target website
1499136598641946628 2022-03-02 13:36:32 -0800 <SimonMDoughty> @ItsAstronomics @HillaryClinton Most "big corporation" jobs pay over min wage these days, even in retail. It's franchise &amp; small business owners, &amp; medium size enterprises that don't pay high wages. Walmart might be an exception, but Target is &gt;$15. Hotel industry is mostly franchise and is poor wages.
1499135482227269635 2022-03-02 13:32:06 -0800 <JasonWSchaver> @DDGZDY @chenweihua @McFaul Um, dead kids are dead kids no matter who the target was.
1499133327093243911 2022-03-02 13:23:32 -0800 <KleezyMatheezy> @BarstoolChief Effective sanctions would solely target Russia's elite, but instead of doing that we're preventing teenagers from playing FIFA characters &amp; shutting off mobile payment tech for everyday people, all while allowing sanctions exemptions for the diamond and luxury clothing industries
1499132410847449092 2022-03-02 13:19:53 -0800 <B4ADavid> So weird that @Target stops taking manufacturers coupons at a time when so many consumers are having a hard time making ends meet. Is this how they can afford the higher base wage?
1499132320330272781 2022-03-02 13:19:32 -0800 <pierrotodontics> @lgbtdrainer PAIR OF THIEVES IS SO FUCKING COMFY DUDE LIKE THE MATERIAL IS SO LIGHT AND SHIT I RECOMMEND THAT SHIT TO EVERYONE AND THEY HAVE REALLY COOL DESIGNS *AND* YOU CAN BUY THEM ONLINE OR AT TARGET
1499131572582293506 2022-03-02 13:16:34 -0800 <1morequestion99> @wvtech @Gee_McK @CourtTV He’s not on trial for murder.  He’s charged for being reckless and incompetent.  Clearly he was reckless in this instance for firing a weapon without having clear sight of a target.  That’s a big NO NO!
1499130386928054287 2022-03-02 13:11:51 -0800 <salkken> @vivakelly The Target should ask them to stay off property. They're harassing customers.
1499127674958086148 2022-03-02 13:01:04 -0800 <gilbertobm> @truthandfiction I keep telling my swedish friends that Escandinavia is the next logical target if you are aiming for Europe's control and territorial expansion. For the norwegian oil and the access to the Norther Atlantic seas. Seems sureal, but Sweden, Finalnd and Norway need to be alert
1499127060773675008 2022-03-02 12:58:38 -0800 <SLKollmann> Well, rumor has it this was indeed for no reason, ha.  (and, on reflection, wartime post-SOTU day is optimal political timing for a same-party DOJ with a significantly more prominent target. I wonder if other USAs are filing things.)
1499126023014825991 2022-03-02 12:54:30 -0800 <Eliott711> @jamie_mcgarity @hodgebone @MaxMarkhamNFL Olave is not a WR 1 he’s a WR 2. Mooney is what Olave ceiling is. They need a bigger target that cAn go up and win a 50/50 ball. They need to replace Arob
1499124759942082566 2022-03-02 12:49:29 -0800 <1morequestion99> @CourtTV He’s sorry that he shot indiscriminately into a house (without a clear target) and Breonna Taylor was killed.  Who shoots a gun without seeing a clear target?  What the hell.
1499119378411003907 2022-03-02 12:28:06 -0800 <UStr8garbage> I’m seeing all these Target tweets about $24 an hour and people getting excited.
1499118375909445634 2022-03-02 12:24:07 -0800 <WhiteTrashTeech> I say it all the time. It's still so funny to me that these spots in the burbs still say now hiring "$12/hr" or "$12-$16/hr".   Minimum wage in Chicago is fucking $15 and most spots at least pay $16 now. The Target by Diversey &amp; Western was at $16.50 in November.
1499117953731682305 2022-03-02 12:22:27 -0800 <BlueLacesII> @BradyRufo @thecrislevy @SouthernSmoke89 @mike___sinatra @SaycheeseDGTL Isn’t that just gentrification? Wouldn’t that just backfire on that exact target audience?
1499115139861295108 2022-03-02 12:11:16 -0800 <stealthebasis> @ISuddenko You're right, that's why we haven't done it up to this point. If I was to do it, I'm trying to figure out who the target audience would be.
1499114027003351053 2022-03-02 12:06:50 -0800 <SteveSchroer1> @NPR Hats off to Target. Im already a customer, but they will get a higher % of my grocery/consumer spending in support of this move !
1499113275174260736 2022-03-02 12:03:51 -0800 <lexton1970> @AOC Ay patita fea, you are so far away from the target, It's sad. The energy to contradict you with facts and common sense, it's better use to make myself a Sandwich. Oh! And just to be clear, I'm not attractive or in love with you! Ok. I just don't agree with your craziness. LGB/FJB
1499111680927834112 2022-03-02 11:57:31 -0800 <nessakwldrl> target system crashed ?? 😭 o hell nah im bout to go into work
1499110826715885579 2022-03-02 11:54:07 -0800 <lydia_brunch_> @sumlenny But what if the Russians use this to target his family, which is what happened in the 1991 Gulf War?
1499109680387350539 2022-03-02 11:49:34 -0800 <lydia_brunch_> @efbgtr @derrickcrowe @moderatemomof3 @mjluxmoore That’s what happened in the iraq war in 1991, they used media images to target soldiers families
1499106657544155138 2022-03-02 11:37:33 -0800 <DanielleSATM> I hate that I have to keep talking about this. It especially sucks with being a double target because of being Jewish. Being transgender isn't a choice. If it were, I wouldn't choose it. I wish I could just wake up and be cisgender and not have to worry which state is safe.
1499105954595495936 2022-03-02 11:34:46 -0800 <_danielaagz> @lizeth_g01 Target girl ! Or shein !
1499105804875620353 2022-03-02 11:34:10 -0800 <chicago_sunrise> @amanda_brooks aren't they terrible?!   I never realized there was such a difference until I used actual Q-Tips at my parents' house last weekend.   these target ones are trash.
1499105762743922689 2022-03-02 11:34:00 -0800 <BobCumbers666> @freeloadingwhor @DrLeanaWen @adam_fallone @PostOpinions A “drug store mask is bout at Walgreens, CVS, Target etc….it’s made in China, it’s worn haphazardly, it’s pulled off dirty car seats, the pores are much larger than the virus particle sizes and it doesn’t do dick.  There is NO quant data to support these masks.
1499104997321199618 2022-03-02 11:30:58 -0800 <mrdj13> @ScooterMagruder I don’t mind it as much on a plane, at Target, etc.   I bartend in a busy bar for 12 hour days, that’s when it’s hard.   Or at least annoying.
1499102064806436867 2022-03-02 11:19:18 -0800 <TwannGoCrazy> My CEO says : “Lopez, Celebrity, great job! I love the new style”   Then the rest of my colleagues decided to target me in the elevator saying the only other people to pull off a turtleneck is 2PAC &amp; Biggie 😂💪🏽
1499097300186062853 2022-03-02 11:00:22 -0800 <jmtubbs> @ToriGlass I guess they’re trying to compete with hobby lobby? Just don’t start playing elevator versions of Chris tomlin or I will be cutting up my target cc.
1499093767780978688 2022-03-02 10:46:20 -0800 <kystevenson_> @seauxjaded Target might be having a lowkey in person sale
1499092943956811781 2022-03-02 10:43:04 -0800 <genxiss> @TabathaLeanna82 @Target Down in Chicago 😭 ended up going to Aldi
1499092818182258690 2022-03-02 10:42:34 -0800 <LangmanVince> My first thought was to think that there is no chance the Democrats could fool on person in America into thinking they are not the party of "Defund The Police"  Then I walk into a Target today and over half the people inside are still wearing face diapers  UGGGGG
1499092758274924551 2022-03-02 10:42:20 -0800 <Doe_Darling> .@Target global outage of registers at #Target target stores.  #targetrun #cyberattacks
1499091109645103104 2022-03-02 10:35:46 -0800 <aye_dree_nn> Target full of shit because I don’t know anyone who’s ever gotten a job there. Lol seriously
1499085604688121856 2022-03-02 10:13:54 -0800 <MidwestHam> Just wrote a scathing review of the Target on Elston. I hope the ppl that run the store don't take it personally. Its just a mess ever since they renovated it. The city should not have big box stores. A few CityTarget, okay, but no Costco sized Targets its just a nightmare.
1499082673452683264 2022-03-02 10:02:15 -0800 <leaveit2bia_> Hmmm, is anybody else’s Target app tweakin?
1499080816281989122 2022-03-02 09:54:52 -0800 <Castantine> @AnthonyWapow @Jonsnow__007 @KillBiI @Ross_Finn @autist1989 @CalDisasters @christogrozev @mod_russia Point to the military target in that video. Reevaluate your life, bro.
1499073773617782787 2022-03-02 09:26:53 -0800 <fineasskg> I’m bored I’m bout to go to target
1499072062975053831 2022-03-02 09:20:05 -0800 <bartii2003> @El_Ninjacat @zaysaintcash @officialwalid1 @Krisplashed Who you gonna play in the playoffs where your starters mostly play the entire game ? Drummond is gonna be any easy target for Philly they don’t have to worry bout it cause Joel will play 35-40 min a game
1499071419497472006 2022-03-02 09:17:32 -0800 <mildmojo> @remembersonly I have experience with both, and IMO it should be separate teams. Devs should know enough about the target environment to find logs and restart services, but another team should handle infrastructure-as-code or hosted services administration. There's too much complexity for devs.
1499071066286788613 2022-03-02 09:16:08 -0800 <Chrissyjev> Is anyone else tired of @Walmart , @Target and @amazon lying about shipping times?! Im so over it. Blah blah order “x” amount in products and get free two day shipping…yet doesnt come for a week…if that their ploy to get u to spend more money? I dont know but its bs.
1499067442399744000 2022-03-02 09:01:44 -0800 <chicago_sunrise> one of the things I regret most about my life is buying target brand cotton swabs in 2021 rather than the q-tip brand.   don't make the same mistake I did.
1499065701063335937 2022-03-02 08:54:49 -0800 <aaquib_nawaz> $FB Proce target of over $300 and here we are right at 200, human psychology, no one wants to be the first, will only start buying when she starts rising. ️
1499062232432455689 2022-03-02 08:41:02 -0800 <sox_oz> Anyone know if they’re making the Target giant boxes again? I know they had them for 2021 series 2 but didn’t see any for update. Those are crazy good $/card/parallel value @CardPurchaser
1499059712368668672 2022-03-02 08:31:01 -0800 <luckyy_lisa> honestly target b fuggin my life up 🥴
1499057447549509638 2022-03-02 08:22:01 -0800 <ChicagoTomTom> @ChrisDaukausMMA @PlowmanEric Here in chicago- it’s rare the intended target gets shot. Usually it’s always innocent bystanders.
1499054342422282242 2022-03-02 08:09:40 -0800 <TheDosageBrand> Y’all being scammed by consumerism on a daily basis. Starbucks/Adidas/Target\Sephora taking all your damn money! People are being scammed DAILY. God forbid people do a little scamming back. 😂
1499053709384421386 2022-03-02 08:07:10 -0800 <LogalboTroy> F Joe Biden! He’s a goner! Fund the police just cost him the black vote. Everyone knows the police savagely target black people. And nothing about helping the poor? Bernie 2024!
1499049728968900609 2022-03-02 07:51:21 -0800 <TravisT_FFB> @Mischakatja @Zeee_Dee @Jordan_Reid I wouldn’t call Mike Evans an elite separated either - he does well for his size and that’s his strength. But still as a WR ranks 51 (in 2022) with 1.66 separation yards per target. A bit of a misleading stat but I wouldn’t be clanging on evans as a separating monster.
1499048850350297091 2022-03-02 07:47:51 -0800 <hacks4pancakes> @JerDavidson @pwnallthethings Temporarily, until Putin regroups and invades the next target on his list.
1499047835869843460 2022-03-02 07:43:49 -0800 <ApeSandBearWich> @DeathHagatha I bought it at Target. Check there or their website.
1499040733868830722 2022-03-02 07:15:36 -0800 <AdamHarstad> @izach120 Waddle scored more points in his first season than Lamb did in either of his first two. Plus he’s never lost a battle for target share with an inferior receiver.  He was also the #6 pick and his new coach is already hyping up his expanded role.
1499039293058203651 2022-03-02 07:09:52 -0800 <BlameItOnBee_> Target run and treating myself to dinner after work! Finna enjoy this me time. 🥰

1499034320555716609 2022-03-02 06:50:07 -0800 <peacelovedesto> just thinking about how target “remodeled” their bathroom for it to look the exact same
1499032552358780929 2022-03-02 06:43:05 -0800 <Peachii_cat> I had a little kid tell me today at target, “your hair looks like cotton candy”. That’s the exact response I want from anyone.
1499026690055581697 2022-03-02 06:19:48 -0800 <greattweetsam> @ScottBAtkinson jfc bill nobody cares if you’re suspicious of the target lmao
1499019268427558915 2022-03-02 05:50:18 -0800 <AdamHarstad> @MattWaldman Key context is there were under-24 WRs who *also* have elite skills like Lamb but who have paired that with high-end production and a demonstrated ability to win target share.  Good chance Lamb gets there. But with Waddle and AJ Brown I don’t have to project it.
1499019012449132544 2022-03-02 05:49:17 -0800 <MzNeauxla> @YallLuvCris Shiiiid I worked at Target part time until February last year. They treated us well. I quit cuz those crazy yt folks was gon have me in jail screaming about them masks.
1499011174100344838 2022-03-02 05:18:08 -0800 <hermightywords> @TristanLudlow10 There’s so much junk out there that I want to puke. When I stopped looking for the evil to be this person or that person, and saw that it is the black goo AI, yeah- it’s all bullshit. All humans are the target. Nothing is real unless it in front of us.
1499008692980703233 2022-03-02 05:08:17 -0800 <Rolliefingers4> @DerekBrunson To bad he missed his target the story would've been a lot better

1499003084143570950 2022-03-02 04:46:00 -0800 <apmsu1025> @Graham_Couch Izzo needs to redefine his approach on player acquisition through the portal and high school recruiting.  There is no reason why MSUs frontcourt should be among the bottom half of a league.  Expand the radius and target more players, embrace the portal, lean into NIL
1498993641238450190 2022-03-02 04:08:28 -0800 <Joseph2237J> Have CNN on tv but muted. Guy with a large PRESS label on his chest is for his protection from becoming a target but Russian hard liners don't respect the press so it really is no protect against the Russian Neanderthal.
1498987411761778689 2022-03-02 03:43:43 -0800 <Reesegawd_> It’s no shade I’m bout to go back and work at target ! 😂
1498968667148767232 2022-03-02 02:29:14 -0800 <MoneyBaggAyo_> @OTacticts I used to work at Walmart only difference is you just gotta be nice at target that’s it tbh
1498954994002935808 2022-03-02 01:34:54 -0800 <SayJ96> @AUDyeHard @Julieahhhh I don't agree I think having both to split the load on the stores is fine. I just don't understand why people are so upset with a Target that students are definitely gonna appreciate. I was just in Auburn and it still had the same small town charm that drew me in in 2014.
1498913068713222146 2022-03-01 22:48:18 -0800 <BeamSplashX> anyway, the reason that one dungeon is bad is that there are landmines everywhere, but your character is keyed to auto-target them. i assume it's so that they can shoot the mines to blow them up pre-emptively, but your character will switch to them mid-melee combo, blowing you up
1498903005613154305 2022-03-01 22:08:19 -0800 <_Sebastine> @JeffInBville @POTUS @KremlinRussia_E When you arm your citizens, you turn them to military target!  It's common sense. If the Russian force sees dozens of women with rifles attacking in all front, civilians or not, they will be neutralized

Meaning, there was no viable target that couldve made this a mistake?  Just questions, I dont expect you to have all the answers.  Unless you do have all the answers. Lol
1498891861188091912 2022-03-01 21:24:02 -0800 <MamaMeelah> It's interesting, I just don't know who's their target audience.
1498889771040776192 2022-03-01 21:15:44 -0800 <PortaPocketGal> @NikMarDim1 @thatmouthybroad I haven't relied on purses in 14+yrs. really an entirely diff experience as no need to babysit PP, &amp;can wear to gyms, sports stadiums, on amusmnt park rides++. risks are almost 0 as not target for theft, as can be hidden under clothing. always hands free. it's simple, &amp; works🌞😊

1498885309987266564 2022-03-01 20:58:00 -0800 <RedDevilWolf> @acid_refluxmore Guess that depends on which Target . . .

1498851693261381632 2022-03-01 18:44:25 -0800 <wascallywose> @SuzeQKnits I hear you. This is a frustrating moment. We have to be true to our democratic and constitutional principles. If we engage in political assassination, we lose our moral authority to expect other countries to behave in a just and democratic way. And we put a target on our leaders.
1498850527081385985 2022-03-01 18:39:47 -0800 <debliss> @aarondgettinger The stakes are so much higher this time, the response so much more idealist. A major power involved. Real risk of nuclear war. Instead of a princely city-state, the target is a democracy of more than 40 million. Yet, no meaningful risk of a draft in the US as was feared in 1990.

1498844991774461958 2022-03-01 18:17:47 -0800 <LuisAngeles> Bragging about imposing sanctions on Russia, ain't it, bro #SOTU  They are evil and are worse than an actual war because #sanctions do not target the military but rather the innocent people of that country, which causes the people of that country to become radicalized against us.

Right now, "concerned parents" across Texas have been given a green light by their governor to openly target and harass families with trans kids. It destroys kids' already fraught ability to exist in their communities.

My point is that Hockenson and Swift back (and potentially another FA or rookie WR) will dilute the target share in DET. ARSB is a fine PPR WR2/3, but I'd sell for a 1st.
1498794407503536131 2022-03-01 14:56:47 -0800 <christopherfort> @bradslyons V true. I guess I was thinking that if everyone was against them, there’s too many enemies and no logical target for any nuke. Mutually assured destruction. But with Putin who knows.

1498771084581163008 2022-03-01 13:24:07 -0800 <Shawn_Foss> @torontoFF8 @SFormatOnly @AndrewHallFF Those target shares are over the last 3 seasons since they've fully transitioned the offense from Flacco to Lamar/Huntley
1498770931547844610 2022-03-01 13:23:30 -0800 <Shawn_Foss> @torontoFF8 @SFormatOnly @AndrewHallFF I think 40 catches for 400 yards is a generous projection.  The Ravens' RBs (not counting FB) have seen target shares of 12.0%, 12.7%, and 11.8%.  They had the 3rd-fewest total RB targets last season despite ranking 9th in pass attempts.

1498767251528466435 2022-03-01 13:08:53 -0800 <EricFST312> I define upside potential as the % difference between the stock’s current price and the average of the Street’s target price estimates.  So if a stock is trading at 100 &amp; the average target price issued by the Street analysts is 130, then the upside potential is 30%.  9/13
1498767247380258819 2022-03-01 13:08:52 -0800 <EricFST312> We know that not every analyst will be right, but if we use the average target price of all the analysts, we’re combining the best Street research to find some stocks with great potential.  6/13
1498767246184828928 2022-03-01 13:08:51 -0800 <EricFST312> One of the outputs of these analysts’ work is target price estimate. The target price is where the analyst sees the stock heading, typically within the next year.  We can harness the power of the target prices that these analysts calculate to our advantage.  5/13
1498763918545723398 2022-03-01 12:55:38 -0800 <Davis_404> @ponderer @TomJChicago So what's the point ever to fighting if the Pig says "I'll use a nuke." and we piss ourselves. He has freedom to do anything anytime he threatens us. Patton was right..we should have taken Russia out as a power   If Putin would nuke a target, WHY ISN'T HE USING NUKES ON UKRAINE?
1498761561623642112 2022-03-01 12:46:16 -0800 <gbkc1414> @mollistan @simu_la_crum @Scott_Broadley @richardfromla @jdavidgoodman Just leave trans kids and their families alone, they don’t need your “help”. And for Christ’s sake, stop supporting politicians who target and harass vulnerable members of your community for refusing to conform to a religious group’s BS.

1498761130105352200 2022-03-01 12:44:33 -0800 <Damn_Datscrazy> Aye wait target raising their minimum wage to $24? 💀 might have to slide back
1498760312689942540 2022-03-01 12:41:18 -0800 <Angie40213068> @ReySantoscrypto It really depends on your target audience that you’re trying to capture.. honestly, more gaw’s creates more fake followers, no offense,, and more learning tweets/calls/videos will pull in your more valued loyal followers! You know and you see it.. 🙌😉
1498757078277623821 2022-03-01 12:28:27 -0800 <LauraLynn209> @legallymom2 @Target I actually asked about this yesterday at the Target at State / Madison in Chicago.  Employee told me he was not required to mask.
1498753929559031828 2022-03-01 12:15:56 -0800 <nbscum> Just got back from target and not even the staff was masked I don't like it I don't like it I don't like it
1498751920512589829 2022-03-01 12:07:57 -0800 <TKo_A90> @__JazzMina I need to see! Because i definitely work right next door to a target
1498750964756590601 2022-03-01 12:04:10 -0800 <dmeyer312> @Daddy_Quack_ @patrickfinley Dropped? You do realize not all targets are catchable balls right? His catchable target rate was 67.7%. That's were consistency will need to come in. Have a good day.
1498749559547527173 2022-03-01 11:58:35 -0800 <JimA21754232> @saj9291113 @outaherefast @WGNNews This is happening anyway. Nevertheless, if Target is offering $24/hour, they obviously need the employees.
1498749120151961604 2022-03-01 11:56:50 -0800 <craftyalannah> Me at Target, wearing sunglasses to conceal my swollen eyes and dark circles: *buys 12 plastic storage boxes and a Squishmallow*  Cashier: “Are you going back to college, honey?”  Me: Yeah. 🥲🕶
1498747581752565767 2022-03-01 11:50:43 -0800 <Erik_Reppen> @SashoTodorov1 @delfoo I'm starting to wonder if the idea wasn't to let them go ahead and hit Kyiv. Let that big giant support disaster of a mega convoy defeat itself by running out of gas, food, morale while they target resupply. And just harass the convoy itself until it all starts to fall apart.
1498745863417569281 2022-03-01 11:43:53 -0800 <JRParham> @mavericksmovies I can imagine several speeches might mention the category not being presented live which will undoubtedly be the target of editing out.
1498744967707115520 2022-03-01 11:40:20 -0800 <ZANTrav> @JCPxDESIGNS As a former (thankfully) target employee, this kind of stuff does happen, but very rarely.   Worst thing I've ever seen personally was someone drop a deuce on the ground in the kids clothing section

1498740400324030467 2022-03-01 11:22:11 -0800 <GippertheGolden> @brithume When you know you are over the target...
1498740366014570502 2022-03-01 11:22:03 -0800 <GhostElmo98> @SkeImoor @NinEverything I'd say 1-2 years. Switch is really showing it's age right now. With PS5 and XSX being the main target for this generation, the Switch could begin to lose Third Party AAA support.
1498738326387503111 2022-03-01 11:13:56 -0800 <sacaitlin> @SpinningSkull @XanozIchimonji @BrooklynSV_ i am definitely not the easy mode target market but yeah
1498736621038063617 2022-03-01 11:07:10 -0800 <444_okami> Target, Barnes &amp; Noble, &amp; Best Buy have great customer service everytime.
1498732249352658947 2022-03-01 10:49:48 -0800 <Erik_Reppen> @delfoo It's a shame the Polish planes rumor turned out to be somebody getting ahead of themselves. Lousy column tactics aside, is it just too big of a target to try and hit with what they have?
1498731785018085383 2022-03-01 10:47:57 -0800 <helllocynthia> No one knows how much I miss u (my favorite downtown Target)

1498729470450151429 2022-03-01 10:38:45 -0800 <Jason1Goff> I was at Target and now I’m at LensCrafters and at both establishments The Cure’s “Friday I’m In Love” has followed me. Can’t be coincidence, right?
1498728749101158401 2022-03-01 10:35:53 -0800 <KLou_34> Target is my love language
1498728115694190594 2022-03-01 10:33:22 -0800 <adamjohnsonNYC> @Jhoratio The idea it will only target the rich is wishful thinking that none of its advocates is even arguing
1498727263675760645 2022-03-01 10:29:59 -0800 <djmattb1200> I asked God to give me a sign. And like always, he’s always on @Target! 🎯
1498725382727647233 2022-03-01 10:22:30 -0800 <Global_Grooms> @Vanilla_Pleshur Easy target for her lol

1498718192738484229 2022-03-01 09:53:56 -0800 <acid_refluxmore> doing the walk of shame (which is what I call walking home from target with a 12 pack of Charmin Ultra Strong mega rolls)
1498716864385622016 2022-03-01 09:48:39 -0800 <Secur80Consult> @mathisstillhope @JoyAnnReid To the contrary, a lot of our military installations are in those states. They are high on the target list.

1498713852850155528 2022-03-01 09:36:41 -0800 <JayMcCarron> @JeremyLayt0n Or they could just target better receivers. Both were pretty disappointing, playing with an MVP and great running game.
1498713813926961161 2022-03-01 09:36:32 -0800 <YouGotDelehanty> @cathymcknight @CMIContent There's a big difference between copying, and tailoring to differentiate and make "better". Anyone can write a piece of content - true differentiated brands make it their own and understand the wants / needs of their target audiences and prospects. #CMWorld
1498712775295705099 2022-03-01 09:32:25 -0800 <FireHeartEmoji> @moongIaives @Lordvonzs Nah walking faster makes you more of a target. I slow down
1498711467880857606 2022-03-01 09:27:13 -0800 <YouGotDelehanty> @CMIContent A4. You stay ahead of the competition but most importantly it shows you're thinking ahead for your target audiences and prospects - it also shortens your sales time and can greatly impact the likelihood of conversions when questions are answered before asked. #CMWorld
1498709357957197833 2022-03-01 09:18:50 -0800 <EzzyWorld> Target about to start paying what? Let me get a lil overnight part time gig or something @Target
1498708515694813186 2022-03-01 09:15:29 -0800 <YouGotDelehanty> @CMIContent A2. Your engagement KPIs and conversion rates suffer, but most of all - you lose a valuable opportunity to align with your target audiences and prospects - give them what they want and need to make a decision - not just what you want to tell them. #CMWorld
1498704867896012804 2022-03-01 09:00:59 -0800 <Ian_Gay_briel> @LiberalDsa I mean, this is unquestionably bad, but the memorial was not the target, it just happened to be next to a broadcast antenna
1498703974844743693 2022-03-01 08:57:26 -0800 <Howell_iDOIT> Going to walk to Target and get groceries during lunch.. official a city gworl.
1498703815150874630 2022-03-01 08:56:48 -0800 <ohnoetry> Wanna know how out of touch businesses are? Lip Smacker, a company known to target to girls, doesn't have any female superhero balms. For girls.

I know the debt ages and becomes less expensive over time...
1498697771959869442 2022-03-01 08:32:47 -0800 <Henry_S45> It’s legal for the US to do “surgical strikes” in Somalia against Al Shabaab, which has never killed a single American. However it’s illegal for Russia to target neo-nazis right next to its border that have terrorized ethnic Russians inside Ukraine for the last eight years? How?
1498697089706078212 2022-03-01 08:30:05 -0800 <sumlikeitall> @DefTechPat More drone strikes on the target-rich Russian convoy would be nice.
1498696957983956993 2022-03-01 08:29:33 -0800 <Levi_Kale> @hedrigal @whstancil CBO report (for CBO reports as are worth) predict job levels won't return to pre-pandemic until '24. And even then, people were famously unhappy with the economy pre-pandemic for the reasons you just said, not because Target wasn't hiring.
1498696476364611593 2022-03-01 08:27:39 -0800 <She_A1_Dope> I Gotta Go In Target While I’m Down Here😊

1498691030610112513 2022-03-01 08:06:00 -0800 <SamanthaSung8> @Target Can anyone wear these clothes, or are they only for black people?
1498688770945830917 2022-03-01 07:57:01 -0800 <ronndadon_> i love target ❤️
1498686620278665217 2022-03-01 07:48:29 -0800 <WgbChristine> Even w/@Target's higher recent + planned spending on labor, investors like what they're hearing/seeing from Target: $TGT currently up more than 11% today. 👀
1498686288425328640 2022-03-01 07:47:10 -0800 <jordanupdike> @Andy_Zesco While certainly NATO is a target and western defense an aim, I’ve come to believe negotiations will include their real primary interest: demands Ukraine cedes the Russian-contested lands where oil reserves happen to be (connecting them to Crimea etc.)
1498686187246075906 2022-03-01 07:46:45 -0800 <group_onlyfans> @chr1s_witkowski @Angelam74756310 @AnonOpsSE wrong solution. The right solution is to target these scammers directly and hack their wallets and donate them directly to ukraine. A lot of these fake accounts are #russians
1498685887625977860 2022-03-01 07:45:34 -0800 <SayJ96> @DrAubie @Julieahhhh Oh thats dope it's about time! Either way though having a target there would literally make it so that you didn't need a car as a 1st or 2nd year student so it's not a bad thing.
1498685350264328192 2022-03-01 07:43:26 -0800 <pfcilng> @jgb00m Guess sanctions hit the target....
1498684231630966794 2022-03-01 07:38:59 -0800 <SayJ96> @Julieahhhh I get what youre saying but the Cstores are not gonna have nearly as much stuff as a grocery Target would have. Also not everyone is gonna be lucky enough to make friends with cars right away or even the first month of college. There's nothing wrong with making Aubs more walkable
1498682208948826118 2022-03-01 07:30:57 -0800 <SayJ96> @Julieahhhh Honest question do they have a grocery store DT now? I went back for Iron Bowl and didn't see one. I feel like this would be good for on campus students and the students that live close to campus without a car for grocery shopping if its the type of target with groceries.
1498681139229306888 2022-03-01 07:26:42 -0800 <Hamilton_Jonson> @Independent This tweet and article are poorly worded. The Governor was not engaged in “racist” abuse but rather a TARGET of two racists.

I am using this tool for some time now and it's giving me accurate results, better than I expected at such a low cost. Another best thing is that it supports 100+ languages which is an add-on for me as it helps me to target local customers as well.
1498671817933922306 2022-03-01 06:49:40 -0800 <Castantine> @owillis Dumbest thing Joe Kenedy ever did. Probably killed his career because it put a big ole target on his back with the leftists.
1498671405168312320 2022-03-01 06:48:01 -0800 <chand1995> @adamvoge That's true. That is why this move is hard to evaluate. We do need some superstars to establish our status back at the top. Lets see who else we target. Maybe he could be one of 2 strikers we buy? 1 for experience and 1 for potential. I'd love to have us back in the UCL with Lewa

Now you can get piercings done at @Target, too. Create relationship with #GenZ to build lifelong affinity/loyalty...

After decades of being the top US target for intelligence, we're still really good at reading Russia or 2. Higher level sources leaking to US due to concern to this course of action.

1498514035746213888 2022-02-28 20:22:41 -0800 <themavf14d> @PMC713 To make it more fun, the political message you might wish to convey would dictate the type of launch platform (land based ICBM, SLBM, bomber) and what the weapon does when it reaches a target (I.e. ground burst, air burst, EMP effectiveness, etc).
1498505659758825475 2022-02-28 19:49:24 -0800 <WazNFL> @SolisReport Or, you know, @jenisicecreams could sponsor us and send us pints of it to reviews for our extremely large audience that is totally their target market. It's just good marketing!

1498496006324895752 2022-02-28 19:11:03 -0800 <Samyann_Writer> Putin lied to his own soldiers, not telling them what they will be doing - told them it was "training".  Putin lied to Ukraine and his own people telling them that civilians were not a target - hundreds are dead, including children.  Send this to someone you know in Russia.

1498486908476928006 2022-02-28 18:34:54 -0800 <Kawaii3dRoofie> Kinda nuts how little the smartphone market has changed since 2018.  Beyond the most expensive models trying to target higher refresh rates, the tech has largely stayed the same.  In some areas, they're downgrades, with headphones jacks and micro SD slots being phased out.

It was more his increase target share. Statistics show that drops are volatile &amp; don’t remain consistent. An example being Diontae Johnson. He went from 13.7% to 5.3% in one year.

1498468206536982532 2022-02-28 17:20:35 -0800 <Sammy_Stukes> @UncleYpmuj Also the fact it’s a smaller target as well as what if it’s moving, especially towards you. Not to mention then possibly of the bullet ricocheting and hitting someone else.

1498435747644428297 2022-02-28 15:11:36 -0800 <TraderGoalieOne> Can't get short $ES until it goes offered below 4335 or if the a.m. open is below 4335 and goes offered below the open. Minor support is 4292-4293.  Offers below 4292 should bring it to our 1st target at 4251-4252. Offers below 4251 has nothing holding it up until-4227-4228.
1498434329885790211 2022-02-28 15:05:58 -0800 <PopNFood> @Chicago_Scanner Did they bring their own Target bags?  Last time I witnessed they were prepared and then went to Potbelly (Lake) and set up the sale outside.  Not kidding.

Russian Intelligence and Cambridge Analytica tipped the scales in 25-30 voting districts, which tipped the state, which tipped the electoral college. They knew exactly which ones to target.   Trump was deeply in debt to Russia. Delivering Ukraine was supposed to be payback.

1498374318572589060 2022-02-28 11:07:30 -0800 <WgbChristine> The move is meant to "position Target as a wage leader in every market in which we operate," the Minneapolis-based retailer said.  ( $WMT minimum hit $12/hr last year; $AMZN moved to $15/hr in 2018.)
1498371374452289536 2022-02-28 10:55:48 -0800 <BadgerNoonan> A smarter group of people would have clear goals (something like "we get expanded post-season and are willing to go concede y items, ideal target = y-z items.)   This just seems like a hostage negotiation.   Aside from the failure, the loss of millions of dollars,

1498358898230706176 2022-02-28 10:06:14 -0800 <realDillonEvans> @MarcBriggs I see your point now. I agree. For instance, I have a price target of 3300 for S&amp;P and 11k for Nasdaq. Where we disagree is on the brief boom. I believe that boom was in the fall when Tesla was at $1200 and Nvidia was at $360.

1498352576466718725 2022-02-28 09:41:06 -0800 <TheChrisMosier> The real abuse happening in Texas right now is an abuse of power. Politicians are targeting trans youth &amp; their families for political gain.  We cannot allow this to happen. The time is now to speak up - about Texas &amp; the 35 other states with a target on the backs of trans youth.
1498352029642723330 2022-02-28 09:38:56 -0800 <MobVDetroit> Nobody GAF about brown people being bombed &amp; starved in Yemen. Its genocidal. #Somalia,#Syria,..?Bombed regularly. #Afganistan?...people abandoned. #Gaza? Basically a prison used for target practice? But blue eyed blonde people see some smoke? "Activate the launchers!" #Ukraine

1498343957285249024 2022-02-28 09:06:51 -0800 <johnsummit> @Ty_Salone my target audience is people who listen to my music. with that criteria u have a target audience of zero

1498342266582097924 2022-02-28 09:00:08 -0800 <RenoPerry> People who went to top schools or worked at top companies get a lot of attention from hiring managers.   But I've seen so many from non-traditional backgrounds become wildly successful, even outperforming their peers from those 'target' backgrounds.  skills &gt; pedigree
1498341902889934850 2022-02-28 08:58:42 -0800 <IsaLeeWolf> @ABC That's not much of a concession given he wasn't supposed to target civilians in the first place.
1498341820052520967 2022-02-28 08:58:22 -0800 <chris__ocasio> @PurcellGregory @wanax2 @fpleitgenCNN Not for artillery to work, you just need to be ready to move after firing 1-2 rounds of a fire mission and to be meeting your accurate predicted fires requirements so you actually hit target on the first rounds.

1498332772838035458 2022-02-28 08:22:25 -0800 <Snyds00> Connor Williams is such an intriguing FA target, in 16 games this past season he only allowed 15 pressures &amp; 2 sacks. He has to clean up the penalties, but I see a potentially incredible value signing #Bears
1498331659908829193 2022-02-28 08:18:00 -0800 <_lucidEntropy> @ChrisLuno love to listen to your mixes right before an exam. Great for calming down and focusing on target 🙏
1498329459069308929 2022-02-28 08:09:15 -0800 <LayWilliams> @alexpriou Hah, it's been suggested before. I guess I'm an easy target!
1498328223700164619 2022-02-28 08:04:20 -0800 <BillColbert> Because what long time Facebook advertisers know is, that you may have a target audience of 100M people. But, only a relatively small subset of that target audience is of value to you. Why? It's because Facebook has user personas, too.

Target civilians, then leave. The US at least stayed to rebuild the damage and try to help the people. Ya know, the war crime as you called it with a blind eye to history once again.
1498303593987944455 2022-02-28 06:26:28 -0800 <prlasteria> Needless to say I will lose it if this becomes another thing ypipo take from niggas. Please go get your press ons from Target and leave our shit alone!!!

1498287961649164289 2022-02-28 05:24:21 -0800 <barrybutler9> @johndietzdh Bingo!  A goal of a business is to grow. That’s maintaining what you have and increase from there. The net-net of what they are doing will alienate a sizable portion of the current fan base and grow minimally with their target. Net-net will be a LOSS  in fans, ratings and revenue

ANYTHING hits this country should be immediately dealt with to the likes which the world has never seen before. We simply cannot allow it. Every military station in Russia should be a target

1498174402780962817 2022-02-27 21:53:07 -0800 <lailanimonet> Going on target runs is a form of self care
1498168402950688769 2022-02-27 21:29:16 -0800 <realRyanEagle> @BullyEsq i think they did earlier - saying that they would target resupply
1498164781420879874 2022-02-27 21:14:53 -0800 <crose84> @yesitsemmyy @notchenford Agree with both of you! They just drop in these random plot points not caring or remembering that it contradicts something they’ve already previously established. Makes it hard to invest in canon when canon is always a moving target. And nothing has emotional impact anymore.

Yeah, no, we're good. Plus, I believe that Russia's "modern" targeting is more focused on our nuclear military capabilities than destroying population centers.

1498099255172599808 2022-02-27 16:54:30 -0800 <Commonm70980959> @TheRickWilson That would be a lot to target.
1498090692488404994 2022-02-27 16:20:28 -0800 <TheSSK_> Like, it's really just that simple. Having a gun pointed to the developers' head asking them to, "Make the game suitable for me", when there is a clear vision/target audience the game is going for, just sounds like blatant selfishness.
1498090347624345601 2022-02-27 16:19:06 -0800 <TheSSK_> After looking at the flack Elden Ring is getting, it reminds me that some people just need to get the memo that sometimes, you aren't apart of the target audience the game was going for, and that's PERFECTLY fine. The game just isn't for you.
1498089052461047818 2022-02-27 16:13:57 -0800 <TaeKariF1> @RachelCanelon @BTS_twt Target?

1498062467632709634 2022-02-27 14:28:19 -0800 <ChicagoTrader92> @supersven99 Yup, target usually hits day 2-3 through, that breakout / bounce back into ER highs is relatively rare. It would be interesting to add a trailing stop to avoid a situation like that but in my samples i have not. I plan on collecting another 500 samples this week

First they attempt an incompetent blitzkrieg where everything was spread so thin they ran out of gas shy of the target. Now they're packing it all into one blast-radius basket.

My super nice neighbor likes red wine so I was actually just looking to get her a gift. I’m not a wine person at all 😅😂
1498047595356340233 2022-02-27 13:29:13 -0800 <Anatwarriordiva> @thomaskaine5 They wouldn’t. Ukraine is too close to Russia. US is their chief target &amp; Putin’s chief adversary. Think like a Cold War Warrior. He wants Ukraine &amp; former satellite countries back. Doesn’t want them destroyed.

Especially knowing Zelensky was target #1. U R such a CPIA (constant pain in ass). Just try once to something productive or go to the back bench

1498014677242155021 2022-02-27 11:18:25 -0800 <_WhiteDiamondz> About to attempt to go to target for 3 things. Imma end up drifting off to the baby section 🥴
1498011229427671040 2022-02-27 11:04:43 -0800 <GeorgeXcorpz> People constantly think I work at Target or Best Buy when I go there do I just give off that kinda vibe?
1498009720883453954 2022-02-27 10:58:43 -0800 <spangledponcho> @YoNewChi Biden's cabinet(staff) are a bunch of corporate/military lackeys. Orgs like Justice Dems exist because the party culture is so right-wing/anti-progressive that they have to create nonprofits to specifically target non-shitbags. The party absolutely "staffs" itself.

1498004770476462089 2022-02-27 10:39:03 -0800 <MaxKnightley> @bonetail_ you're not ENTIRELY wrong but this is post-Blood Money, they had at least figured out "he kills as few people as possible besides the target" and "it's funny when you put him in a clown suit or a chicken costume"

1498002975259709442 2022-02-27 10:31:55 -0800 <brionda05> Drive up definitely helps me spend less money in Target .

1497988319011028999 2022-02-27 09:33:41 -0800 <Turaynel> @13eechamFR Games like Elden Ring are cult like games. At the end of the day just because something is widely acclaimed doesn’t mean everyone is the target audience. I’ve tried fromsoft games in the past and do not enjoy them so I concede that they are well made games just not for me.

We just kinda lived with that thought.
1497985410013802508 2022-02-27 09:22:07 -0800 <NorwoodTheThird> So many niggas panties in a bunch over this bel air remake lol. Remember that just bc you’re not the target audience for something, doesn’t mean there isn’t a ton of demand for it.
1497984621325303813 2022-02-27 09:18:59 -0800 <FinaIIY_Rich> @rxdsza @lwtmount @ftbleman @BoyFromNeukolln @AbsoluteChelsea Lol good job to mount not even hitting the target almost like I predicted he was useless in the final 3rd
1497982213438291975 2022-02-27 09:09:25 -0800 <t_lacy> I'm becoming convinced that Putin actually wants to use a nuclear weapon. I hope I'm wrong, but my mind is turning toward his desired target. Somewhere in Ukraine?  Or use one of his recently developed hyper-sonic ICBMs to make a demonstration for the world?
1497977714849898496 2022-02-27 08:51:32 -0800 <JayJames553> @TIME @michaeldweiss That building doesn’t look like a military target to me. Russia needs to pay reparations to Ukraine as well as every other former Soviet block country forced to live under Russian Communist rule! The world needs to start confiscating Russia assets.
1497974333377064963 2022-02-27 08:38:06 -0800 <keepupwitTri> Let me head to target 🥰
1497972870827311107 2022-02-27 08:32:18 -0800 <TMzyzptlk> @ImSoProudofDrew @ReelvZero @AP MIRVs beg to differ. Their shortcoming will be target accuracy and yield variances.
1497970259298435072 2022-02-27 08:21:55 -0800 <_Eric_Reinhart> @Hamultonne They’re different models w/ shared goal of universal coverage for target populations. M4A more realistic near term, as existing US health infrastructure is overwhelmingly private. To try to nationalize in short term would be disaster; long-term, it should be the goal, I believe.
1497969211293028352 2022-02-27 08:17:45 -0800 <ThatGirlSandraG> could’ve given it to the mail carrier and it would’ve been returned to Target. Maybe my luck is turning around…
1497963862401994755 2022-02-27 07:56:30 -0800 <brnfshn> {circumstantial}  If you have children and their noses can tolerate the scent, have them SAGE you. They’ll think it’s fun 1) 2) they’ll target areas where you are storing energy that’s important to keep. Important to process.   A dancer has seen and experienced many rituals. HOLD
1497963379360600070 2022-02-27 07:54:35 -0800 <hinxstinx> @pomsonfire Actually going to Target for poster board (and a glue stick) today.
1497961846837592067 2022-02-27 07:48:29 -0800 <receeYES> You thought TARGET was expensive before, try going in there now. Inflation is a mfker!!! Everything up except these pay raises.
1497959419040124934 2022-02-27 07:38:50 -0800 <JohnPGlynn> Get in loser, we’re going sledding down the huge snow mound in Target’s parking lot.
1497955845136596994 2022-02-27 07:24:38 -0800 <arash_tehran> No, don’t kick Russia out of the World Cup or any such clearly civilian affair. What good does that do for anyone?!   Instead of this buffoonery, target the oligarch circles + send defensive armament to Ukraine
1497952560400920576 2022-02-27 07:11:35 -0800 <TheStoneRL> @julie_kelly2 The deep state is running the show - as they always did. The Comedian is not even a bad joke.  Top target: to turn Ukraine 2022 into Afghanistan in the 80s, remixed.  With a Neo-Nazi International in the previous role of Jihad Inc.  The same old imperial play book.
1497951532607852551 2022-02-27 07:07:30 -0800 <John2019R> @johndietzdh It looks to me they are going to target under 35 to 40 to grow a much younger fan base and appeal to Corporate sponsors with diversity and inclusion front and center. Not saying this is wrong it’s just going to introduce a different look than most NHL teams have. Time will tell.
1497935103875502085 2022-02-27 06:02:13 -0800 <ashleyebraxton> @Target was the first person to tell me happy birthday…. And y’all wonder why I’m always there 😂
No more data. finished scraping!! is it though? because sometimes twitter lie haha.
