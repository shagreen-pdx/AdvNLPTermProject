1500886380687200256 2022-03-07 09:29:32 -0800 <AnthonyLeeZhang> This is pretty socially damaging, however: Apple may genuinely have not realized the tech was patented. If Apple learned early on that the tech was patented, it could switch to a different tech. If I strategically wait, this ties up a ton of Apple's money + resources in lawsuits
1500886142077464578 2022-03-07 09:28:36 -0800 <AnthonyLeeZhang> Before suing them. This will increase the payoff from suing them, since my awards will be calculated based off Apple's profit from the tech. If I sue too early, Apple will not have made any money from the tech so I won't get anything. This is basically "patent trolling"
1500885928922910720 2022-03-07 09:27:45 -0800 <AnthonyLeeZhang> Suppose I create a valuable technology, like a phone antenna tech. I see Apple stole my antenna tech to use in their phones. Under current regulation, I have an incentive not to report this right away. Instead, I should wait until Apple made a ton of money using my tech

1500828809939009537 2022-03-07 05:40:46 -0800 <PoofNJ> I just heard Woz tell a story about how early on in the company, all Apple employees got a 10% discount. And people would use that to buy relatives computers when they needed it. Except for Steve Jobs. His sister needed a computer and she asked him for a discount and he said no.

1500699591968268290 2022-03-06 21:07:19 -0800 <snd_dsigner_dan> Is there anyway to add different profiles to Apple TV+?

1500682417811734535 2022-03-06 19:59:04 -0800 <pollitt> @Revelintheblue Kimhants in the wild can be a bit skittish, you have to approach them with care. They are, however, very fond of apples, and if you catch one and they gently cup your face, it means you have their heart and they'll be yours forever.
1500679222578270213 2022-03-06 19:46:22 -0800 <AntiNewDems> Apple is almost certainly releasing a VR headset this year and it‚Äôs rumored to be around  $2500. The Oclus Quest 2‚Äôs are $300 and amazing. If you slim the form factor down into something comfortable, changes the way we live. feels like the dawn of the mobile age.

Comparing an expensive phone, that serves many functions in an adult's life, to a hockey puck, which was obtained for free, and serves zero function in her life, is an absurd comparison. Apples/oranges.

What has been consistent in those 13 years are a few bad apples trying to gaslight companions into believing a title/description she uses is "supposed to" include x or y as well. üòí

They raised prices since people relied upon it and they could. Then people blamed the 'other side' because they wanted a villain to fit their narrative.

Coupled with automations in Shortcuts, it's even better.   But even as a mostly Mac user, I know the Apple Way of doing things isn't always the best. So you adjust and find tweaks.

It‚Äôs just not great for anyones mental health, that‚Äôs all.

1499869064495349768 2022-03-04 14:07:05 -0800 <Reetzy830> @anthonycwalker @Apple Last thing, only use necessary apps to run cellular at all times. I know some things sound like ‚ÄúDuh! No crap‚Äù but with years in customer to engineer matters, some things that appear obvious get overlooked. Stay safe!
1499868233435959307 2022-03-04 14:03:47 -0800 <Reetzy830> @anthonycwalker @Apple @anthony, if still having issues, message me with your phone model, worked in telecommunications for nearly 20 years. If I don‚Äôt have possible solutions, I will reach out to my geek friends. I‚Äôm going to msg you my phone #. Check that you are on latest version.

Your phone is then forced to check surroundings. Also close as many windows/apps as possible. I also recommend going through settings and change so only ‚Äúimportant‚Äù apps will use cellular or satellites

When traveling a phone will stay with its last known strong signal. Even if you are standing right beside a tower, if previous tower is still going strong, it won‚Äôt switch unless the first tower starts showing weakness.

More pain is coming.

Withdraw your security tokens into a private wallet on a blockchain like having Apple‚Äôs physical share certificates.

But it also sucks the life out of a room of friends: it's an individual experience.   I suspect Apple's moves towards AR is in recognition of that.   We don't need more isolating technologies.

1499126837842169872 2022-03-02 12:57:45 -0800 <Tavarin> @alyssakeiko As far as I can tell, Apple+ releases new content at 3 AM EST
1499126817088749576 2022-03-02 12:57:40 -0800 <jellin76> @TristanSnell @Disney @Apple @FedEx @UPS Caught my typo, should be *its*  Oh....wish we had an edit button.
1499126051724795904 2022-03-02 12:54:37 -0800 <Marvinhawkins> @TheChiScroller Yeah I get it. For me it's A Charlie Brown Christmas. Can't watch it unless you have apple. Even though Disney plus has Charlie Brown stuff. It's all very silly
1499124932780990470 2022-03-02 12:50:11 -0800 <patrickklepek> "We have a new apple, for everyone in the world."  We Know the Devil. ‚úÖüëø

1499123541127663627 2022-03-02 12:44:39 -0800 <Justiniodiddly> @PhatChimpanzee @ulmostinsane @Hurtsvania @Karan8263 @MLB Magical elves turn apples to magic apples to the delight of many. A farmer partners w/ them at his farm, and they split the 200 fairy coins from the customers 100/100. Soon the show brings in 500 coins, but the farmer decides he should get 350 and the elves only 150
1499123392972308481 2022-03-02 12:44:03 -0800 <stats_tipton> Friends, I am in need of tech help. My kids have iPads and Apple accounts, but no phone numbers. They use Messages to text. My mom has an android (Verizon). I cannot for the life of me figure out how to connect them. Please tell me there is a simple way.
1499122218265108482 2022-03-02 12:39:23 -0800 <DonnHa> Well I did it! Only a few more days until hopefully the 5G usb-c iPhone SE3 is announced. There were temptations along the way but I've held out and hopefully will have the device I want at the price I want to pay. #apple
1499121483968307207 2022-03-02 12:36:28 -0800 <jellin76> @TristanSnell If @Disney, @Apple, @FedEx and @UPS want to stop supporting people who are actively trying to hurt our democracy, our future and it's people they should also stop donating to republicans. The biggest threat to our country is the cultish GOP.

1499117463547568130 2022-03-02 12:20:30 -0800 <5Magazine> @qburns @dada_drummer If they intentionally bought a low-margin business to prove Apple's 30% take is untenable, that would be a crazy flex.
1499111698048987136 2022-03-02 11:57:35 -0800 <ClarkFoster8> @francska1 AYYA ideas stolen from Apple, have fun idiots.
1499107623915958278 2022-03-02 11:41:24 -0800 <lightning_lisa> @AppleSupport @Apple how dare you take RT off App Store. Why didn‚Äôt you take every US backed app off store after our illegal Iraq invasion? And our 20 year occupation of Afghanistan? And all the other illegal wars we‚Äôre in NOW? Hypocrisy overwhelming! #BanCensorship #FreeSpeech
1499106643442810882 2022-03-02 11:37:30 -0800 <_teteeee_> Im get my Apple Music back once my man album drop 3/11 ‚ù§Ô∏èü§™

1499102220528373760 2022-03-02 11:19:56 -0800 <lookatlauren> Question: why does my apple watch keep telling me to stand when I'm already standing?
1499101617005731849 2022-03-02 11:17:32 -0800 <hoffridder> @Bandcamp All this time I thought Bandcamp was owned by Apple

All for a virus that only 0.003% might die from, even less w/ early treatment options that the media lies, saying doesn't work
1499101269390147588 2022-03-02 11:16:09 -0800 <Tesper2> Can apple hurry up and release the AirPod Pro 2‚Äôs? Mine are dying

1499099638137249794 2022-03-02 11:09:40 -0800 <nickselman> Apple Music was handed a price-insensitive, power-user audience on a silver platter by Spotify and hiked it out the back of their own end zone. Pitiful.
1499099269424427009 2022-03-02 11:08:12 -0800 <Matthewosowsk17> I know I have another Pawa call Powercore know how I Apple hobby cut doing the movie practice waiting hydrate did it do you have a boy ever happened to you know what I do you have a Gayhanna boundary and pick up the whole Dadonov Howerton I have a red devil payments

1499098293967720451 2022-03-02 11:04:19 -0800 <nickselman> I want so badly to finalize my switch to Apple Music but, man, this software absolutely sucks.
1499098287957237764 2022-03-02 11:04:18 -0800 <sammie9er> @RepMTG Everyone was covid tested before SOTU, 5 found positive before the event &amp; not allowed to attend. No daily negative covid test required for kids or staff to enter school buildings everyday‚Ä¶but go ahead, continue to put apples next to oranges and call them the same thing.
1499096036693925893 2022-03-02 10:55:21 -0800 <PopeyesFNRP> are apple seeds poisonous

1499091732184584197 2022-03-02 10:38:15 -0800 <embirdened> @Richie_Sombrero Unclear atm--Epic has fought with Apple over platform dominance but also is 40% owned by Tencent which has stakes in the majors too. Also gamers are pointing out that Epic's dev/support work Bandcamp sold out for is often shit
1499091478580236288 2022-03-02 10:37:14 -0800 <wristkry> @1mmanuel_ she fye still. u rly have to apple the pressure to the back

1499088095530135556 2022-03-02 10:23:48 -0800 <swemoney> @hasanthehun If you have an Apple Watch, the app Health Data Server can do the same overlay thing. App works with just the watch and connects directly to their cloud so it's pretty easy to set up.

1499085478687084548 2022-03-02 10:13:24 -0800 <DocRackedUp_> @DistrokidR Any update on Apple Music royalties
1499085262760124423 2022-03-02 10:12:32 -0800 <whatthefidd> @bainard I'm unsure P4k or Rolling Stone have as much of an immediate knowledge handle on something like Epic, whose claim to fame is creating their own app store as a result of not wanting to pay Apple (or Google) as much of a cut to simply be offered on their app download platforms
1499084097905467392 2022-03-02 10:07:55 -0800 <Victoriar745> @diegobonito4 @youradiccion Supongo que en Spotify puedes utilizarla sin pagar y Apple Music a fuerzas necesitas pagar creo

1499083606429425669 2022-03-02 10:05:58 -0800 <joseph_peart> @ijustine Given the state of the world and that Ukraine is being attacked, this Apple Event could simply just be a press release imo. Seems a bit tone deaf.

I used to sleep in the office (shock horror) and wake up to fresh baked donuts before school. My favorites were an unadulterated old fashioned and the apple fritter.

1499063960120832004 2022-03-02 08:47:54 -0800 <JoshiSunny> Hey @Apple would it hurt for you to make a power cord that actually sticks to the laptop??

We are all a lot more interconnected than we‚Äôve ever been. Boomers are going to learn this the very hard way.
1499046395298430981 2022-03-02 07:38:06 -0800 <ChicagoMSTie> @Tuskermax @the_moviebob Wait, have you *met* Apple?  Apple: Your contract with us only licenses the hardware to you; it still belongs to us. We have already contacted your employer and are garnishing your wages to cover the full retail cost of the device you have destroyed. Have a nice day.
1499045010108465160 2022-03-02 07:32:35 -0800 <FMSupreme> We have to abolish the two party system. We need a People‚Äôs Party. The RED &amp; BLUE does not represent you. Both parties are bought and sold everyday like apple stock on stock market #SOTU

1499032513758568451 2022-03-02 06:42:56 -0800 <j_mcnally> @LikelyMitch I'm sorry not trying to be Argumentative, i just don't see why Apple would abandon WebKit at this point for Gecko. WebKit is Apple's baby, and the foundation of Blink. I think one solid OS code base, with lots of vendors / contributors in OSS is healthy enough.
1499032408888610818 2022-03-02 06:42:31 -0800 <TyConsolino> @GRDecter I'm on your team baby girl but you're comparing apples and oranges.

But you are profoundly misguided if you think that it worked better OUTSIDE Russian than inside. Come on, listen to yourself.

1499022170529447936 2022-03-02 06:01:50 -0800 <Teih2x_> Russians can no longer pay for Netflix and Spotify with their bank cards, they also can no longer use Apple pay or Google pay. Before we get rid of cash and go fully down this path, it's worth thinking both about the fragility of the system, and who can turn it off and on.
1499021993731051521 2022-03-02 06:01:08 -0800 <GeorgeXcorpz> It is criminal that none of the katamari soundtracks are on Spotify and Apple Music non-remixed I have to use YT music

1499001748861730817 2022-03-02 04:40:41 -0800 <puldajos> @monarchcurl I think a lot of people are essentially arguing apples and oranges here, she‚Äôs saying ‚Äúhair growth‚Äù in marketing isn‚Äôt a real thing because your hair is going to grow a certain length each month anyways, most people disagreeing are saying ‚Äúmy hair grows if I do xyz‚Äù lol
1498986535785480192 2022-03-02 03:40:14 -0800 <DontizzleJones> The fact that Apple and Google can decide on a whim who can use their payment services is good and bad
