1496878130690248715 2022-02-24 08:02:11 -0800 <UNLVNacho> @iMxCarter In peak American millennial fashion - on my peloton.
1496871849182973955 2022-02-24 07:37:14 -0800 <lucy_conroy> My boyfriend’s mom followed me on peloton and it’s precisely the motivation I needed
1496866320285147143 2022-02-24 07:15:15 -0800 <blanca_jara1> I caught up on @alextoussaint25’s Ride to Greatness and the thighs are feeling extra thick today. 💪🏽 #peloton  #ChiTownFitThick
1496862797950562305 2022-02-24 07:01:16 -0800 <maddyho7> Peloton studios are set to open this summer…booking a flight to NYC rn
1496681465014280197 2022-02-23 19:00:42 -0800 <emilyjoria> Honestly nothing speaks to me quite like the 2000s emo/punk rock Peloton rides
1496673882341789703 2022-02-23 18:30:35 -0800 <elvis_fg> @jimcramer With this drop There are two dozen reasonably priced companies with excellent quality, high competitive advantages, revenue growth and good future prospects and you look at Peloton 🙃
1496672664446021637 2022-02-23 18:25:44 -0800 <EGF4> Anyone know how to remove an instructor from the “Your Instructor” featured on @onepeloton?  #pelotonprobs
1496649062157897732 2022-02-23 16:51:57 -0800 <KendraThomasEsq> I bought the TRX straps for home to put by the Peloton so I will be well on my way to making sure I’m staying pain free.
1496629162274131971 2022-02-23 15:32:52 -0800 <JamesMarsh79> @nntaleb @trishankkarthik I need to short more Peloton. Thanks for the reminder
1496575331788070925 2022-02-23 11:58:58 -0800 <jowehh> Some days wellness means a 45 min peloton session on my lunch break.  Some days it’s not.   Today, it’s replacing my workout with a huge bowl of pasta. #balance
1496562537734840323 2022-02-23 11:08:08 -0800 <familyonstandby> @onepeloton @Delta Does this count for your streak? Haha!
1496558189520773120 2022-02-23 10:50:51 -0800 <DSTrendologist> Fun stat: "Peloton has about 2.1m customers paying to use its exercise bicycles or treadmills. For comparison, about 3.5m households in the U.S. had birds as pets during a recent year. Peloton might be less popular than parakeets, but it gets far more attention." via @nytimes
1496549090913570822 2022-02-23 10:14:42 -0800 <wenhardy> @ChelseaJaya @onepeloton @ATCQ I want to, but yawl too advanced for this old guy. You’re into your 3rd move by the time I’m on the floor!

1496293690645655553 2022-02-22 17:19:50 -0800 <amcgrk> @onepeloton It’s ….. let us know the network outage has been cleared up. 🤦

1496284102638641152 2022-02-22 16:41:44 -0800 <ImMisstacy> @onepeloton An email message would've been a great idea. Maybe try that next time. And if you could bring back some of the folks who were laid off so I don't have to wait another month to have functioning metrics, I'd be ever so grateful. Thank you!

1496171859469082625 2022-02-22 09:15:43 -0800 <aribendersky> @edible_words @chihenn Peloton app was down earlier too. The world is officially crashing
1496171043160997898 2022-02-22 09:12:28 -0800 <jennbrazen> being in a peloton fb group may the most annoying thing ever when there is a service outage or any big news. For some reason, everyone feels as if they must post about it.
1496166768146059265 2022-02-22 08:55:29 -0800 <chelss__23> Peloton cost $1500 right now… I MIGHT HAVE TO JUST GONE AHEADDDD! 😅😅

1496165395186737155 2022-02-22 08:50:02 -0800 <amcgrk> @onepeloton @onepeloton This is why you need to open up the peloton software platform w/ screen usage just in case your network goes down or you go BK!! You can do much much better.
1496165212281520131 2022-02-22 08:49:18 -0800 <okaypanda> @mattlindner Legit me right now. Also, Peacock and Peloton were supposedly out this morning too.
1496163594316271616 2022-02-22 08:42:52 -0800 <amcgrk> @WHYC_ Same issue. @onepeloton anything going on?
1496160687776837638 2022-02-22 08:31:19 -0800 <lilbmer> @onepeloton Need to make video of refreshing app and pacing in front of tread!!!
1496158822792060930 2022-02-22 08:23:55 -0800 <_abhayshah> @mweagle @SlackHQ Is this a slack problem though? I'm seeing weird outages elsewhere (GitHub, Zoom, Peloton) and nothing on the AWS side ... though all the services use AWS.
1496156923833556992 2022-02-22 08:16:22 -0800 <Danielamonte20> @onepeloton I thought it was my Wi-Fi 🤯

1496153932837625870 2022-02-22 08:04:29 -0800 <commuter_haiku> Sure, @onepeloton is down, but @PopTartsUS is not!

1496151134205095944 2022-02-22 07:53:22 -0800 <meghan_chism> @onepeloton @sarayelich Funny cuz outage report site determined that was a lie. Don’t test me I’m full of preworkout right now

1496146894950649858 2022-02-22 07:36:31 -0800 <ivyapool> @studioMboston @onepeloton Yes. Bike and iOS app. @onepeloton

1496144926861574147 2022-02-22 07:28:42 -0800 <adwoa14> Is @onepeloton down?
1496138994509303815 2022-02-22 07:05:07 -0800 <devrajoyPT> @SportsDPT @onepeloton I got a nice treadmill several years ago from one of those used equipment stores. When they switch out the gym and hotel equipment it gets resold. A much nicer treadmill than I could have gotten otherwise.
1496136915317370880 2022-02-22 06:56:52 -0800 <JakeKaneMD> 4 minutes into my @onepeloton ride, my metrics froze.  I felt lost, abandoned, defeated... but since video kept going, I finished the 20 minute ride. Is anyone else beholden to cadence, output, and resistance the way I clearly am?  #pelotonmedtwitter @PelotonMed

1495993063814086664 2022-02-21 21:25:15 -0800 <madd_oh> Loving lanebreaker on @onepeloton just need more optionssss
1495965411497684999 2022-02-21 19:35:22 -0800 <themrzt> Nothing will induce a harder—seismic, really—eye roll from me than seeing “gamified” from a brand.   Peloton’s Lanebreak though? Earned. Like Guitar Hero for your legs.
1495941328915640329 2022-02-21 17:59:40 -0800 <KanyeOfMyKrew> @ana_bananza Nice!!!  I purchased a Peloton and I love it. I had trainers during the pandemic and was able to maintain a bit…maintained muscle but gained some fat. But the motivation is low. I’m in Chicago and the weather and it being dark out at 6am is NOT the motivator is needs to be.
1495940347167453185 2022-02-21 17:55:46 -0800 <kdotmart> @BlersTalking Where we didn’t even get the ball below the three-point line? I was on the peloton and nearly threw my phone
1495926813452873728 2022-02-21 17:01:59 -0800 <mattlindner> @ShawnaOhm Sarah’s teaching tonight, I did an hour on the Peloton and I don’t have the energy to even microwave something so yes, this argument works for me
1495890413437259781 2022-02-21 14:37:21 -0800 <rene_plz> just started following cody the peloton instructor on tiktok &amp; i’ve never been happier. the gemini excellence!
1495883745932500999 2022-02-21 14:10:51 -0800 <jthomas> @MattWilpers any plans the Lanebreak will have a option to use Power Zones for lanes? @onepeloton
1495833868116676610 2022-02-21 10:52:40 -0800 <no_ice_5> Okay @onepeloton — being an avid Rhythm Game enthusiast (think DDR), you guys got me hooked on Lanebreak. Now, just a) add more music packs and b) maybe the Tron soundtrack and a Tron overlay (you’re right there, it’s perfect)

This is a combination of: - Tracking every calorie in and out with MyNetDiary, and never exceeding my plan - Replacing dining out with Factor75 - A smart scale with body comp - Buying a Peloton and using it daily + my normal fitness routine
1495466301652934664 2022-02-20 10:32:05 -0800 <JoME_Escobar> @onepeloton when will you offer free shipping on tread again? You’ve shaved the cost of 2800 salaries, think you can afford it. #peloton
1495151798570696704 2022-02-19 13:42:22 -0800 <BeccaPiano> And why are these Medicare Disadvantage ads STILL filling the airwaves in Feb? I thought it was just for open signup sched which ended Dec/Jan.  I'm even getting a little annoyed at George Foreman and that ad's the least excruciating of the lot.  Peloton-level-annoying ads.💣💥💨

Now I’m pregnant with baby #2 and at 37 weeks I’ve rode almost every day of this pregnancy! 🎉
1495103215658057730 2022-02-19 10:29:18 -0800 <john_kirby> @JackWilliaMSU only two holders Jack. Need to talk to peloton about this problem.

1495092604383514630 2022-02-19 09:47:09 -0800 <WinningSolo> @calalouf I've been a Peloton guy since the pandemic.  It's tough to make excuses when the bike's in the next room, taunting me.  😄
1495091992673636354 2022-02-19 09:44:43 -0800 <whodoulovenow> Have not slept yet. Feel somewhat on the verge of a sleep deprivation induced freak out, but hoping a hearty breakfast of tacos and margarita and Ativan will put me in a mild food coma long enough to let my brain and eyeballs take a nap. Or should I do Peloton til I collapse?
1495064426512273411 2022-02-19 07:55:10 -0800 <DKhanMD> @onepeloton Time for a new All Star ride with the MVP @alextoussaint25  🏀⛹🏽‍♂️
1495051361498636296 2022-02-19 07:03:15 -0800 <ColyerAndy> @onepeloton Lanebreak is awesome.  Would love to see it combined with live instruction, to have @alextoussaint25 and others coaching and encouraging me from the top right corner. Should also combine with Powerzone.

1494792842266529796 2022-02-18 13:56:00 -0800 <tylerlansdown> @krispekitty @onepeloton I just hit my 100 yesterday.  You get a free shirt!!

1494745663120281605 2022-02-18 10:48:31 -0800 <rocket_4457> @cadeinvests @BusinessFamous $1290 Polo Guy absolutely has a gym room in both his primary &amp; weekend residences. Still has never used the Peloton, but has been meaning to
1494743272157241344 2022-02-18 10:39:01 -0800 <krispekitty> @MochaGorilla @onepeloton 😭😭😭😭🙏🏼
1494738467556896775 2022-02-18 10:19:56 -0800 <supppshell> @princessslex @onepeloton You’re going to LOVE IT
1494727238981492742 2022-02-18 09:35:19 -0800 <WinningSolo> @Bronwyntagg Also a pint of water upon waking. Gratitude journaling. Take wifey to work. 60-90 minutes on top-priority task. Peloton.  (Rest of the day is less structured.)
1494709128488488964 2022-02-18 08:23:21 -0800 <connor_skelly_> @brianne2k Love this. peloton needs all the help they can get right now!
1494708839232462849 2022-02-18 08:22:12 -0800 <MaksxWin> Peloton 1 Amaka 0
1494708030981779465 2022-02-18 08:18:59 -0800 <ChrisBrathw8> @daratreseder @onepeloton I have a snapchat video from 2019 riding the bike at a hotel in which I say the bike is great, but didn't think it was worth getting. Three years later I just completed my 1750th ride after getting the bike April 2020. Best pandemic purchase I made.
1494692539156385794 2022-02-18 07:17:26 -0800 <KristenGeil> The correct name for @onepeloton’s “Lanebreak” is Pelotron and I will not be taking questions on this.
1494691515955875845 2022-02-18 07:13:22 -0800 <cornellianScott> @onepeloton these new video game rides! 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
1494669597672419332 2022-02-18 05:46:16 -0800 <lewdog73> @onepeloton is sure busy today..they must’ve hired a social media person
1494668390065131525 2022-02-18 05:41:28 -0800 <JessDaMess247> taking a peloton class specifically because the playlist starts with the rascal flatts version of life is a highway from the cars soundtrack
1494662776727523329 2022-02-18 05:19:10 -0800 <BeyondShades> @onepeloton It’s fun
1494534823418945553 2022-02-17 20:50:43 -0800 <Rationalization> Peloton would be so lucky to be Amex in Inventing Anna. #productplacement #amex #InventingAnnanetflix
1494530102402691072 2022-02-17 20:31:58 -0800 <DeannaMarie208> @saltylungs @PelotonMed @keylargofoley @onepeloton Yay! Way to go, my friend. You deserve it! We are so glad to be a small part of making it happen. You are the best of #PelotonMedTwitter
1494529629805240327 2022-02-17 20:30:05 -0800 <paigemklarkin> @gretchemaben CONGRATS! Unfortunately I’m on a bike hiatus currently but cheering you on! If you ever want to a peloton yoga, I would love that! ❤️❤️
1494506386654470146 2022-02-17 18:57:43 -0800 <leeeGill> Those HIIT classes on Peloton ain’t no joke
1494501549376163859 2022-02-17 18:38:30 -0800 <kidfloral> Tell miles on my peloton type shit and some weights my fat ass will lose weight I promise you that
1494498014932742144 2022-02-17 18:24:27 -0800 <domdeliev> @onepeloton Lanebreak is amazing! Video games + cycling… what a concept!
1494490844627447829 2022-02-17 17:55:58 -0800 <starnes_vicki> @lifewinterest Can you do yoga a few times a week and Peloton too?
1494487399451312131 2022-02-17 17:42:16 -0800 <MelWronko> I cannot find the queen himself, Cody. But his workout on Valentine’s Day… killlllled! Then the next day @jesskingnyc salty ride.. THAT was it! 🔥🔥🔥I am still very much obsessed and worth every $ with @onepeloton
1494448805739175943 2022-02-17 15:08:55 -0800 <lechevre> Lane breaker is pretty cool @onepeloton !
1494432463514390533 2022-02-17 14:03:59 -0800 <Mopar440_4> Hey @onepeloton been waiting 2 weeks for someone to respond about a bad bearing. Last time this happened I at least got a response within a day. What gives?
1494424023324938245 2022-02-17 13:30:26 -0800 <emceePMC> @ItsReapAgain Reap, did you break LaneBreak on peloton yet?
1494389127659278337 2022-02-17 11:11:47 -0800 <MightyInkMatt> @kdc This article began and ended its reason for existing as a way for the author to flex Peloton ownership. Everything else was filling a word count.
1494384503627960331 2022-02-17 10:53:24 -0800 <kathrynswartz> Peloton Lanebreak is fun as hell and 10 minutes made me as sweaty as 30.
1494211029596839940 2022-02-16 23:24:05 -0800 <MDLtee> It’s 1 in the morning and you’d swear I haven’t eaten all day. I’m hungry as hell. SMH   Why do I even get on the peloton?! 😐🙄
1494151050282029058 2022-02-16 19:25:45 -0800 <DanteTheDon> @LydonFrankie @onepeloton @UproarChi We got good ones
1494140199839928323 2022-02-16 18:42:38 -0800 <AyyeDenay> Is there not a full drake ride on @onepeloton ?! Asking for myself 🙃
1494135482476863489 2022-02-16 18:23:53 -0800 <firestopper77> Meanwhile. In many homes, alone in the basement, the @onepeloton is thinking sadly, "I remember when I was the thing you spent 20 minutes doing while ignoring your family. Just you wait #Wordle... you'll be replaced soon too.
1494100553789542403 2022-02-16 16:05:05 -0800 <yoppumwaters> @mags_mclaugh i use a myx bike that was like 1100. it’s like a cheaper peloton. i did interest free payments of like 100 a month for the last year and it worked out really well! just paid it off bought it in dec 2020
1494072669888786441 2022-02-16 14:14:17 -0800 <upthecatpunx> @annehelen A peloton for every room!
1494040092889030660 2022-02-16 12:04:50 -0800 <jordan_koss> @annehelen @benthompson It’s reinforcing when 2 analysts from different worlds reach similar conclusions. Peloton is at the intersection of so many trends (I loved your series on Peloton celebrity). When I ask my teenagers who they’d most like to meet, it’s a YouTuber/TikToker. For me it’s Denis Morton
1494036757347807237 2022-02-16 11:51:35 -0800 <jordan_koss> @annehelen Monday’s issue of @benthompson ‘s Stratechery newsletter focuses on Peloton. He agrees that their core subscription business is fantastic. Their problem is hardware. They’ve mismanaged the supply chain, misgauged the size of their market (bc expensive bike), and have poor R&amp;D
1494036250126340104 2022-02-16 11:49:34 -0800 <jordan_koss> @nnschiller @annehelen My read has been the opposite! Zwift wants to be Peloton! Zwift let go of a lot of developers to focus on building hardware
1493991998797369348 2022-02-16 08:53:44 -0800 <nickseguin> @gilbert @AcquiredFM Should we be listening  *on* the peloton?
1491440345833697281 2022-02-09 07:54:22 -0800 <SHAKINGash> OK did anybody else read the Blackwells presentation against Peloton? That shit had me blew lol
1491120473660616707 2022-02-08 10:43:19 -0800 <theluisdiaz> @LetMeSpinCoach @onepeloton Worth the $$!
No more data. finished scraping!! is it though? because sometimes twitter lie haha.
