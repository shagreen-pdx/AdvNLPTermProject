How normal is it to cry during a peloton workout Asking for a friend peloton
I m a new rider and let me tell ya is the midday pickup I ve always needed
Absolutely Honestly at this point I m thinking about spending money on adjustable weights so I can do my strength stuff in my apartment along with Peloton because now going to the 7th floor is too much lol
Purchasing a peloton has been one of my better investments They have both a tread and bike option
Good job Legs on a Monday morning respect

I do follow for the most part so I might start with that good idea

As much as I love my little bootleg Peloton setup I am really ready for it to be warm enough to ride outside again
I finally did my Mary J Blige ride It was my best output to date The playlist is impeccable
I had to be nice on the peloton Med account but that s mean Ugh On the other hand good for you
It s as important as high impact Active recovery days are the key
Dude that s why you incorporate low impact rides two or three times a week I just hit 100 straight weeks Haven t had one injury Knocks on wood
that first peloton ride after having strep throat
Planning to hit the later today Got my first one in this week and it was pretty awesome
Okay that walk run class from 2 23 with was so good She s such a great instructor and when she said something like sometimes it takes a lot of effort to pull back I felt that
Live core bootcamp class with today I think those are my fave bootcamps right now strongCoreinthemaking
So glad that has two bikes so I can work out to counteract all the sitting I m doing during specialtyreview2022
First ride in the books Thanks
She s so good

She was the exact same in person as she is on the rides so extra she made me retake the picture like 3 times I think her music is the best personally I need to get back in a good rhythm was 4 5 days a week for a while but been slacking
when are you putting games on these bikes How many times do I have to ask I need gems gold rings something
We need to start a Bengals Peloton crew JDWhoDey13 on there as well I need people to keep me motivated we have the bike and tread but I mainly use the bike
Hey I loved our ride in Big Sur Where we going next rideyourbike permagrin
It s like the steady stream of Peloton PRs when I started It s not getting easier I m getting stronger
Just tried a Peloton Lanebreak ride It was fun Different for sure It s nice to have more options
Being an outdoor runner has benefited me a lot Has made me a better tread runner And running on my peloton tread has made me an overall better runner WinWin runnerTweet
Thanks for the ride in Oahu It was beautiful even on a bike with broken metrics hawaii
The ride is INSANE more of this kind of artist series please Most fun I ve had working out in a long time
Haha Absolutely Let s do it
My class is a 45 minute Tabata Music is all 80s hair bands Guns N Roses Ratt Motley Crue Poison etc Would be my dream for to program this one
Have not slept yet Feel somewhat on the verge of a sleep deprivation induced freak out but hoping a hearty breakfast of tacos and margarita and Ativan will put me in a mild food coma long enough to let my brain and eyeballs take a nap Or should I do Peloton til I collapse
Love this
I m old enough to remember when they took away Obama s blackberry and Biden s peloton
It s fun
We got good ones
I have a handful of chronic health problems that reduce my metabolism to nothing I m finally figuring out that as much as I love my Peloton cardio alone does nothing for me and fully embracing the heavy weights
Worth the
Hey riding friends Do you have a favorite ride workout or trainer that you always go back to
They wouldn t allow the hashtag BlueLivesMatter They pushed BLM They continue to be so woke it s such a turn off Flying social Justice hashtags in my face is not what I m there for did it to themselves GETWOKEGOBROKE
that s not how time works bitch me when the peloton coach is lying to me about how many seconds are left
rage inducing when i m really pushing myself 15 min into a hiit work out and i look at the screen and the instructor is just chillin
Peloton is a modern day cult
Absolutely devastated to inform you that I just caved and signed up for the Peloton app and it s getting me to actually work out for the first time in literal months ain t no way I m buying that pricey ass bike I m using a 300 knockoff
that peloton treadmill looking real nice rn with how cold it is outside

You would think I would have spent more time on leading up to the wedding but I could not focus on that I m ready to get back riding tho
I just saw an ad for that Peloton thing people have been raving about I had no idea what it was I thought it might have been some kind of food
Honestly with the near term challenges it could definitely keep going down but now the valuation leaves much more room for upside I see the lockdown period as the marketing opp of a lifetime everyone knows Peloton now Long term the brand is in a really good position
TSLA perma bulls for sure People are loyal to the peloton product but I haven t met anyone who s as religious about PTON stock as TSLA
What s on our wedding registry pots pans mixing bowls What I wish was on our wedding registry a Peloton a Jrue Holiday jersey a gift card to our favorite sushi restaurant
