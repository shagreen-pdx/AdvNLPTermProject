and then taking it down to ending warm up for drunk face and back up to fast for forget me too ur welcome I be a peloton instructor
My boyfriend s mom followed me on peloton and it s precisely the motivation I needed
Honestly nothing speaks to me quite like the 2000s emo punk rock Peloton rides
With this drop There are two dozen reasonably priced companies with excellent quality high competitive advantages revenue growth and good future prospects and you look at Peloton
I bought the TRX straps for home to put by the Peloton so I will be well on my way to making sure I m staying pain free
I need to short more Peloton Thanks for the reminder
Some days wellness means a 45 min peloton session on my lunch break Some days it s not Today it s replacing my workout with a huge bowl of pasta balance
Does this count for your streak Haha
Fun stat Peloton has about 2 1m customers paying to use its exercise bicycles or treadmills For comparison about 3 5m households in the U S had birds as pets during a recent year Peloton might be less popular than parakeets but it gets far more attention via
I want to but yawl too advanced for this old guy You re into your 3rd move by the time I m on the floor
I think your followers wanted the shot of you on the Peloton with a Bud Light but Jessica Chastain is always a treat
fyi you got mentioned in a transplant medical journal which I personally think is pretty awesome
Love Peloton classes
An email message would ve been a great idea Maybe try that next time And if you could bring back some of the folks who were laid off so I don t have to wait another month to have functioning metrics I d be ever so grateful Thank you
No one Peloton instructor CAN T SAY I VE EVER FELT LIKE A PLASTIC BAG BUT I LOVE THIS TRACK
Peloton cost 1500 right now I MIGHT HAVE TO JUST GONE AHEADDDD
This is why you need to open up the peloton software platform w screen usage just in case your network goes down or you go BK You can do much much better
Legit me right now Also Peacock and Peloton were supposedly out this morning too
Need to make video of refreshing app and pacing in front of tread
Sure is down but is not
Funny cuz outage report site determined that was a lie Don t test me I m full of preworkout right now
No service in Chicago I was about to ride my 1450th with Jenn live
No service in Chicago and I was about to hit 1450 rides on Jenn s live climb
Mine is down I was trying to get a ride in while my baby napped and now I won t be able to
I got a nice treadmill several years ago from one of those used equipment stores When they switch out the gym and hotel equipment it gets resold A much nicer treadmill than I could have gotten otherwise
4 minutes into my ride my metrics froze I felt lost abandoned defeated but since video kept going I finished the 20 minute ride Is anyone else beholden to cadence output and resistance the way I clearly am pelotonmedtwitter
Loving lanebreaker on just need more optionssss
Nothing will induce a harder seismic really eye roll from me than seeing gamified from a brand Peloton s Lanebreak though Earned Like Guitar Hero for your legs
Nice I purchased a Peloton and I love it I had trainers during the pandemic and was able to maintain a bit maintained muscle but gained some fat But the motivation is low I m in Chicago and the weather and it being dark out at 6am is NOT the motivator is needs to be
Where we didn t even get the ball below the three point line I was on the peloton and nearly threw my phone
Okay being an avid Rhythm Game enthusiast think DDR you guys got me hooked on Lanebreak Now just a add more music packs and b maybe the Tron soundtrack and a Tron overlay you re right there it s perfect
Haha Absolutely Let s do it
My class is a 45 minute Tabata Music is all 80s hair bands Guns N Roses Ratt Motley Crue Poison etc Would be my dream for to program this one
Perfect answer
What works for me may not work for you This is a combination of Tracking every calorie in and out with MyNetDiary and never exceeding my plan Replacing dining out with Factor75 A smart scale with body comp Buying a Peloton and using it daily my normal fitness routine
when will you offer free shipping on tread again You ve shaved the cost of 2800 salaries think you can afford it peloton
I was thinking about hopping on to try it today It s fun
Good job
After having my first child moving to a new neighborhood without a fitness studio close by my Peloton motivates me brings me joy and keeps me on track Now I m pregnant with baby 2 and at 37 weeks I ve rode almost every day of this pregnancy
That spin move was smooth
you cut 2800 jobs How about free shipping on a treadmill
Have not slept yet Feel somewhat on the verge of a sleep deprivation induced freak out but hoping a hearty breakfast of tacos and margarita and Ativan will put me in a mild food coma long enough to let my brain and eyeballs take a nap Or should I do Peloton til I collapse
Time for a new All Star ride with the MVP
Lanebreak is awesome Would love to see it combined with live instruction to have and others coaching and encouraging me from the top right corner Should also combine with Powerzone
recently did your Coldplay artist series ride and really enjoyed it Have you considered a 3DoorsDown ride or other ArtistSeries rides peloton
Love this
I m old enough to remember when they took away Obama s blackberry and Biden s peloton
Oddly only available on the bike but not on iOS
They really put a Peloton instructor in there
Oh great can t wait Mazel tov
I just hit my 100 yesterday You get a free shirt
1290 Polo Guy absolutely has a gym room in both his primary amp weekend residences Still has never used the Peloton but has been meaning to
You re going to LOVE IT
Also a pint of water upon waking Gratitude journaling Take wifey to work 60 90 minutes on top priority task Peloton Rest of the day is less structured
Love this peloton needs all the help they can get right now
I have a snapchat video from 2019 riding the bike at a hotel in which I say the bike is great but didn t think it was worth getting Three years later I just completed my 1750th ride after getting the bike April 2020 Best pandemic purchase I made
is sure busy today they must ve hired a social media person
It s fun
Peloton would be so lucky to be Amex in Inventing Anna productplacement amex InventingAnnanetflix
Yay Way to go my friend You deserve it We are so glad to be a small part of making it happen You are the best of PelotonMedTwitter
Lanebreak is amazing Video games cycling what a concept
Lane breaker is pretty cool
Peloton Lanebreak is fun as hell and 10 minutes made me as sweaty as 30
We got good ones
i use a myx bike that was like 1100 it s like a cheaper peloton i did interest free payments of like 100 a month for the last year and it worked out really well just paid it off bought it in dec 2020
It s reinforcing when 2 analysts from different worlds reach similar conclusions Peloton is at the intersection of so many trends I loved your series on Peloton celebrity When I ask my teenagers who they d most like to meet it s a YouTuber TikToker For me it s Denis Morton
My read has been the opposite Zwift wants to be Peloton Zwift let go of a lot of developers to focus on building hardware
OK did anybody else read the Blackwells presentation against Peloton That shit had me blew lol
Worth the
because sometimes twitter lie haha
