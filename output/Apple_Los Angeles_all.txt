Plus 2.9m lb at $29 to profit at $140. And most importantly ISO technology with 109 m lb production in 2025. That would put over $10B. Many more yo come
1501414375911051266 2022-03-08 20:27:36 -0800 <cuzzinneenee> Spotify could be down for a week. I still wouldn’t pay for Apple Music

1501412644795949058 2022-03-08 20:20:44 -0800 <ezewholesale> Apple’s first event of the year has just held. The theme, this year, was speed. Apple is bringing fast 5G cellular connectivity to the new iPhone SE and its new iPad Air. #AppleEvent See this thread for all the highlights!

1501412441770500098 2022-03-08 20:19:55 -0800 <stufalk> @MikeIsaac May one assume that the many appearances of the Apple logo on Super Pumped is not a product placement or do they really want to be associated with Travis Kalanik?
1501410644372848641 2022-03-08 20:12:47 -0800 <tsvph1> Today - Im just super happy:   1.  Proud Boy leader Enrique Tarrio was indicted on serious charges,  2.  Guy Reffitt found guilty in 1st J6 case,  3.  Russian spy friend of Maria Butina indicted  4.  Cool new Apple products announced.
1501410644339220480 2022-03-08 20:12:47 -0800 <NicSaharaXXX> @dILLON_cASSIDY_ Ugh this is so sad to hear… I can never stand behind someone being exposed in any way that may have them feeling vulnerable if it’s what I think it is I’m sorry for the bad apple that may have ruined the industry for you not all of us are like that 🥺
1501410197050249223 2022-03-08 20:11:00 -0800 <yuusharo> @SnazzyQ Yup, and importantly, the Studio doesn’t replace the thing people needed and relied on – it just adds an option to the lineup.  Glad Apple learned their lesson on that finally.

1501409085744242691 2022-03-08 20:06:35 -0800 <redstonegeneva> Just know if @BodyByO318 visits you &amp; you have kids he will try and convince you that your 7 year old needs $20 an hour wages, your 14 year old needs $10 a day for lunch and your college bound child needs cash app &amp; Apple Pay
1501407795760877574 2022-03-08 20:01:27 -0800 <KelleyWillis> This is NOT an ad.  Have watched 13mins of ep1 of “1971” on Apple+. Starts with KentState killings, CSNY singing Young’s “4 Dead In Ohio”, and protest marches about the war against blacks.  Exactly 50 yrs ago. Nothing’s changed except the music…and the Draft.

1501401231373131785 2022-03-08 19:35:22 -0800 <ChrisChowNow> @kh @TheRideshareGuy His argument amounts to saying Apple isn’t innovative because they’ve been making computers for 40 years.
1501401222946852872 2022-03-08 19:35:20 -0800 <Spectrobits> Today's Apple Event was all about stuff that wasn't flagship, which is fine, but I'm really interested in flagship stuff. Mainly, I want to see what the new AirPods will look like, both Pro and Max.  Of course the MacBooks and iPhones and Apple Watches won't change much.
1501401061940088836 2022-03-08 19:34:42 -0800 <justseeby> @laffer1 @rihanoa @FoolsBelieve @tbay007 @Apple That’s great! It doesn’t seem like you were priced out of something from Apple that you wanted.  Some people prefer the OS, the ecosystem, the hardware &amp; software integration, the industrial design from Apple. Maybe that’s what they’re paying for? All parties happy. Love it!
1501399674598559745 2022-03-08 19:29:11 -0800 <Paleowin> @TM9380 Peaches, my other horse, is very very picky, so she dictates what the treats are. She won’t eat anything peppermint, berry, or apple flavored, which limits our options. Sausage will eat anything tho. Also Sausage stole a small amount of ice cream cake today before he was stoped.

1501398033044365316 2022-03-08 19:22:40 -0800 <JamaulCannon> @JeffPassan Is apple going to send a stream of a fence adjacent to a baseball Diamond with a huge padlock on it each Friday?

1501397160838909955 2022-03-08 19:19:12 -0800 <thisistechtoday> @codywanner I'm amazed at how much a ton of motions graphics will make FCP come to a stop. It also struggles with a lot of smartphone video. Apple silicon hasn't had these issues.

1501394746769432578 2022-03-08 19:09:36 -0800 <IMBRITTANYBROWN> @kevinbennylee The explanation is APPLE MUSIC bro. Yea…They got their issues but not like this 😅

1501392147198537730 2022-03-08 18:59:17 -0800 <neek____p> I wish there was a way for us to block certain artists from being played on our Apple Music during shuffles
1501391925819035655 2022-03-08 18:58:24 -0800 <worldofcrap> I'm not in a place where I can change my main workstation to Apple Silicon yet, but DAMN do I wanna see some benchmarks for the M1 Ultra. Also, FFS @dts, update your encoder
1501391558511259650 2022-03-08 18:56:56 -0800 <mvazquezespinoz> I love my Apple Watch, however today I had to restrain my client and after a 25 minute tantrum my watch had the audacity to ask me if I was done with my workout. I legit just had to laugh it out
1501391493054881795 2022-03-08 18:56:41 -0800 <slut4mrchalamet> Spotify is back. Thank god. This Apple Music shit was confusing I hated it.
1501391142704791554 2022-03-08 18:55:17 -0800 <MileySendS> I didn’t even know about the Spotify thing until I open twitter cuz Apple Music &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Spotify
1501390733873352705 2022-03-08 18:53:40 -0800 <CloseTaRican> Apple is falling into the exact same trap as they did before Jobs came back in ‘97. A CVS receipt’s-worth of products for consumers to have to choose from is almost sure to be a net negative on their bottom line.

1501384202612199428 2022-03-08 18:27:42 -0800 <CarsonJFBruno> On a side note, I’d like to point out that there isn’t a non single-family home housing emoji (at least on Apple iOS). Goes to show just how pervasive our anti-housing choice culture goes in the US.

1501381589565018125 2022-03-08 18:17:19 -0800 <raregirltrea> So apple music changed kehlani’s verse on her and jhene’s b.s remix???? … They do that?? I’m so confused.   I thought I was trippin. But the lyrics still the same as the old verse, even though the song is different.
1501380817766916098 2022-03-08 18:14:15 -0800 <andsand0504> I forgot to change my Apple ID name so the Apple tech people are referring me to John Cena

1501379725486219273 2022-03-08 18:09:55 -0800 <madebybela> ok I dunked on the Mac Studio in jest a bit but it's cool Apple is continuing to push the concept of the Mac desktop. Mac mini wasn't even really a contender before compared to the iMac/MacBook, now you have an evolution of that that basically beats the shit out of both of those.

1501377638677368836 2022-03-08 18:01:37 -0800 <cambam1963> @Utadacore @jaxajueny you can add whole albums and playlists to your apple music library at once. on spotify youd have to go add each individual song to your liked songs playlist. it just takes a while. its easier on apple music
1501376788475248647 2022-03-08 17:58:15 -0800 <Kingplay808> @Apple Nobody wanna go through the bullshit y’all put people threw with the Mac mini 😂
1501376726038990858 2022-03-08 17:58:00 -0800 <plantmamiii> guess it’s time for me to use my 3 month trial on apple music.
1501376426276102144 2022-03-08 17:56:48 -0800 <denilsonareval2> Whoever can send me there techno playlist form Apple Music I’ll greatly appreciate it 🥳🤪
1501376242292981762 2022-03-08 17:56:05 -0800 <RachelKimsey> @HannahDoveVA I like to put a splash of vinegar in my water (apple cider, Trader Joe’s has a delicious red raspberry, whatever works for you) The water is hydrating and the vinegar makes you salivate (I happen to think it’s delicious too but YMMV). It’s an old hiking trick I use in the booth.
1501375796962676742 2022-03-08 17:54:18 -0800 <gamerwoman3d> @GamerMomLuna Clear - white vinegar Red- pomegranite vinegar Orange- apple cider vinegar Yellow- lemon Green - pickle juice Blue - balsamic vinegar Violet - fig vinegar Pink - grapefruit Brown - chocolate and ghost pepper Black - black pepper
1501375592431640578 2022-03-08 17:53:30 -0800 <garden_eyes> name one thing spotify has that apple doesn’t we got podcasts interviews daily playlists creating customized radio stations and 100,000 songs instead of 10,000
1501374854561337348 2022-03-08 17:50:34 -0800 <tentwentysixpm> as someone with a low resting heart rate, the standing ring on the apple watch chooses violence daily.
1501374334438449155 2022-03-08 17:48:30 -0800 <ChuckGenesis> @ramon_rican everything but spotify, apple music just has a grip on my soul and won’t let go 😭
1501373281068142592 2022-03-08 17:44:19 -0800 <jeremiahjw> why are voice memos on iOS an absolute pain in the ass to use and why hasn't apple acquired marco polo yet

1501372362268102657 2022-03-08 17:40:39 -0800 <brewnnut> @mlbtraderumors Less visibility.  Some fans don't have Apple TV+.
1501372282605760522 2022-03-08 17:40:20 -0800 <FutureHasbeen> @JeanLuc_Lemur Still is as long as the Apple Pan stands.
1501371861245960192 2022-03-08 17:38:40 -0800 <JBowdacious> @ryking45 @michaelkammes @Apple The main issue is usually lazy developers not creating an apple silicon native version, but Rosetta works well for most apps. That said, I’m pretty sure all my daily use apps are native at this point.
1501371440670842880 2022-03-08 17:37:00 -0800 <ReadeWolcott> apple announcing a new m1 series is pretty bold considering they can’t seem to fulfill their current m1 orders
1501371248726605829 2022-03-08 17:36:14 -0800 <JBowdacious> @ryking45 @michaelkammes @Apple Haven’t had too many myself, but that’s a valid concern with all new hardware.
1501371010477481992 2022-03-08 17:35:17 -0800 <Jorzaofficial> @Apple you guna put hdmi 2.0 instead of 2.1 again? was pretty disappointed upon getting my macbook pro just assuming we were well into the age of hdmi 2.0 being old af
1501370948770877444 2022-03-08 17:35:02 -0800 <wilgieseler> @siracusa Good to know, but I have a Apple silicon Mac so I can’t run Windows on it (and games are all Intel anyway). Does Boot Camp give you display drivers for brightness too? I couldn’t figure out how to get those drivers on my PC and using Windows is maddening.
1501370805858361352 2022-03-08 17:34:28 -0800 <JessFrmTheBlocc> @Kbeatz12 Lol I beg to differ. And really?? I think I’ve had that issue a couple times where some songs aren’t on Apple Music lol but I’d rather stick with apple still

1501369608527249410 2022-03-08 17:29:43 -0800 <sobhitsarora> I finally have a reason to say why Apple Music is better than Spotify
1501369488519806979 2022-03-08 17:29:14 -0800 <johnnyutah269> @Apple I suppose some people don’t have faces for Face ID…. Jobs would be sad

1501368072556343302 2022-03-08 17:23:37 -0800 <macdru> @713_News @Apple No innovation? I think designing their own mobile SOC and developing them into a desktop computer is innovative. No other company has done that yet. Steve Jobs didn’t do much after the iPod anyways, just all talk.
1501367975407804422 2022-03-08 17:23:14 -0800 <Marisa_TorresV> @Femboy_Stolas @PermianSailback If you can’t accept someone calling out an inaccurate comparison, I’m sorry then you are lacking debate skills. Literally the basis of debate is to point out logical fallacies like an apples to orange comparison.

1501366997073887232 2022-03-08 17:19:20 -0800 <TillyBridges> @starplanes Hi! I’m executive producer of Pendant Productions (@pendantweb), we’ve been running since 2004, had six shows in Apple’s top 60 all-time scripted sci-fi podcasts, won bunches of Parsecs/AVAs. Everyone seems to always forget about me in these lists! So here I am! 🙂

1501366420461948933 2022-03-08 17:17:03 -0800 <jeykay_47> @ztr808 @SabrinaSailor @SmokiTx @inventmattt Nobody cares about the sound quality Spotify has a way better selection and better Percys. This coming from an Apple Music user. (Only cus it’s free for me) and after using Spotify for most of my life I gotta tell you, I don’t hear the difference.

1501364761019105280 2022-03-08 17:10:27 -0800 <cloudsinmybeer> Apple’s time estimates for updates are some kind of relativistic measurement I think.

1501363217699782656 2022-03-08 17:04:19 -0800 <DaveMendez> I don’t think there’s a need for M2 yet. All Apple Silicon is incredible. M1 MBA and iMac are still incredible!
1501362926271098880 2022-03-08 17:03:10 -0800 <houmanhemmati> @Apple Can you plug 2x Studio Displays into 2021 MBP M1 Pro? Daisy chained or separately plugged into MBP? And can you daisy chain an older Thunderbolt Display into a Studio Display? If yes I’m buying!
1501362693994807299 2022-03-08 17:02:14 -0800 <coldgamelou> Thank god for Apple Music

I actually sat next to John Wooden there once, and he told me that he went every Thursday and Saturday and then he told me what he ordered every time (the only diff on Sat is that he added pie) :)

1501354256950915072 2022-03-08 16:28:43 -0800 <HSI_TV> Discussion of the new Mac Studio in the Unreal Virtual Production forums aren't favorable.  "Apple is a consumer product," says one person.
1501354174960701443 2022-03-08 16:28:23 -0800 <sxniiia> since spotify is down i have to use apple music 💔💔
1501353754636869639 2022-03-08 16:26:43 -0800 <JacksonNadir> Apple has given us tools to build in Augmented Reality, but still no hot reload for Xcode.   Bro plzzzzzzzz.  Hitting command +R every time is basura.   (Yes I know this is a 1st world problem)

1501352876400005123 2022-03-08 16:23:14 -0800 <thisistechtoday> @CIKProductions @ZavitzLee Apple definitely needs to work on its software stability right now.  The plugin incompatibilities come from M1.

Since everyone reports everything slightly differently.  And 2 services are doing so well they don't have to report anything! (Apple and Amazon)

1501346322506420225 2022-03-08 15:57:11 -0800 <tammygolden> Apple has just trademarked the phrase "app" so you will have to call them something else and also you cannot order appetizers without paying a fine. Downloading is only allowed through your preferred A*p store. #AppleEvent

1501343618790879238 2022-03-08 15:46:26 -0800 <JBowdacious> @gunleik @michaelkammes @Apple Word is this is the last M1 chip, but who knows. They seem to scale pretty well so far.
1501343609781506048 2022-03-08 15:46:24 -0800 <SloanWorkshop> @IanCutress @RyanSmithAT @mangeurdpommes @anandtech If the speed on M1 Ultra is so good with that many CPU/GPU cores, are there that many workloads that Apple would be targeting that would make the engineering effort worth doing something revolutionary?
1501343282063810563 2022-03-08 15:45:06 -0800 <mixedbymatty> Hey @AvidProTools another apple computer dropped today that pro tools isn’t compatible  with. I got a M1 MacBook pro and I can only send emails. Lmao. What’s the hold up?? All other daws work. #avid #protools
1501343171342528515 2022-03-08 15:44:40 -0800 <tammygolden> New Apple products will no longer have any charging ports and when the battery runs out you have to buy a new Apple product #AppleEvent
1501343167991275531 2022-03-08 15:44:39 -0800 <Ricky_Tinez> @jugwine1 @Apple That vintage USB 2.0 sound
1501343073644670976 2022-03-08 15:44:17 -0800 <darkmanx2g> @TheActualTech No, I am not. The iPhone 11 and XR is still being sold as a brand new device in Apple’s website and lineup.
1501342825442463747 2022-03-08 15:43:17 -0800 <cambam1963> @GShepse @Neiaa_C @jaxajueny well i think it makes a big difference and also spotify wont let you shuffle your whole library like apple music
1501342824410664964 2022-03-08 15:43:17 -0800 <bobtheswitchfan> @Apple What about the iPhone 14
1501342802986225664 2022-03-08 15:43:12 -0800 <KatLaRonde> Spotify really fucked up by going down today because I figured out that Apple Podcast app has been to a good therapist and has figured some of it’s stuff out.
1501342617287622656 2022-03-08 15:42:28 -0800 <bobtheswitchfan> @Apple I already have one tho

1501342346020995081 2022-03-08 15:41:23 -0800 <handleym99> @witeken Hmm.   Apple can say the exact same thing (M1 going into iPad Air now, A13 going into a display). No Intel tax any more.  Which is relevant because *the* fight over the next few years is about the large cloud vendors going to their own SoCs ala AMZ...
1501342284503076866 2022-03-08 15:41:08 -0800 <laffit> @ylona_garcia @AppleMusic @travismills 🔥🔥

1501342207101444096 2022-03-08 15:40:50 -0800 <LAFANPULSE> @JeffPassan Apple TV+ is trash... "more illegal" streams for me.
1501342140932132872 2022-03-08 15:40:34 -0800 <laffit> @dev_lemons @travismills @AppleMusic 🔥🔥
1501341565540724737 2022-03-08 15:38:17 -0800 <adrie_d> @jaxajueny Lol Spotify was down and I still wouldn't re-download Apple. Musicheads know.
1501341445138964480 2022-03-08 15:37:48 -0800 <TherapistJayy> @Mo_Apple @NajlaYMB Those the parents that wonder why they never hear from their adult kids when they get to college 🥴🥴🥴
1501341348032495616 2022-03-08 15:37:25 -0800 <Dreal_sabali> @RapidMax01 Lol should we be debating stuff like this....I have a Samsung  and also uses iphone,first I get the cash so I buy am,secondly both serve different purpose, my bank card works well,I don't use any other music app outside apple music....
1501341248371630085 2022-03-08 15:37:01 -0800 <obryvnt> @prfera_wg @_JrAnthoony Lol it’s on U.S Apple Music sha

1501341060789772291 2022-03-08 15:36:17 -0800 <rubitonyachest> @big_business_ Na that shit is the truth I got every single song I wanna listen to in my pocket. That 9.99 Apple Music is easily the best $10 I spend each month
1501340878891221001 2022-03-08 15:35:33 -0800 <soundbybiru> Bruh I didn’t even realize there was an apple event today…Feels good. 🤣
1501340446722707457 2022-03-08 15:33:50 -0800 <TherapistJayy> @Mo_Apple @NajlaYMB I do love it! Turn it into a family session. And you know I’m quick with a “let’s collaborate to make some ground rules together” 🥲😂 cause what you’re not going to do is make my client feel like their voice doesn’t matter.
1501340110758965249 2022-03-08 15:32:30 -0800 <Beachgurl1401> @BillShaikin I hope SNLA shuts this down. We pay extra for Spectrum for a reason. I’m not watching Apple TV every Friday night which is what they’re going to try and do to us. Dodgers better step in.
1501339986754371591 2022-03-08 15:32:01 -0800 <uni1y> Spotify out for 1 hour and all you Apple Music mfs think you Jesus
1501339941028057088 2022-03-08 15:31:50 -0800 <mividapocha> i pay for both apple music and spotify cuz i need both for djing i have been effectively unaffected
1501338937679171589 2022-03-08 15:27:50 -0800 <Cyclebrity> @mikaela__caron I think the pricing for those exceeds the average credit limits of the Apple Credit Card 💳 👀

1501338222659473411 2022-03-08 15:25:00 -0800 <BrianKemm> @anildash @CedarRapidsBen It was the first optical mouse by Apple to my recollection (major improvement over the circular ones with the CRT iMac), and the two USB ports on the keyboard were 🤌🏼🤌🏼
1501338153981923328 2022-03-08 15:24:44 -0800 <emmasnotdead> I’m “U2s ‘songs of innocence’ album showing up in your apple library without your consent or purchase” bold.

1501337534911025158 2022-03-08 15:22:16 -0800 <BrianKemm> @anildash @CedarRapidsBen The best keyboard and mouse apple ever made
1501337456271974405 2022-03-08 15:21:57 -0800 <KirikTheOrc> @GamerMomLuna Minty apple flavored!  It's a bit spicy
1501337419886432259 2022-03-08 15:21:49 -0800 <diegolpzx> When @Spotify is down but you still have @AppleMusic as a backup 😎

1501337008781684737 2022-03-08 15:20:11 -0800 <kyaanu> The Apple Music girlies must be so unbothered today huh
1501336963168702466 2022-03-08 15:20:00 -0800 <cambam1963> apple music is offering free one month trial rn btw. so L for spotify i guess
1501336782754832384 2022-03-08 15:19:17 -0800 <Drew_E_Johnson> @Apple Does the M1 chip work with ToonBoom Harmony or Storyboard Pro yet?
1501336664311877635 2022-03-08 15:18:48 -0800 <michaelkammes> @JBowdacious @Apple Same.
1501336313693233160 2022-03-08 15:17:25 -0800 <ThaRealQueenPin> I want to go through my Apple Music library and delete some songs it’s too many I don’t listen to
1501336088945692684 2022-03-08 15:16:31 -0800 <abc7danny> We tell you about some new @Apple updates,  3pm @ABC7 with @abc7ellen
1501336002719195139 2022-03-08 15:16:11 -0800 <AnyaWalsh14> @DaisyEagan Wth, why is your rating only at a 3.9 on apple? Anyone who hasn’t rated you needs to go give you a 5⭐️ rating asap! I listen to A LOT of podcasts and yours is above and beyond with the writing and humor. I gotta get my friends and family on board.
1501335758614978562 2022-03-08 15:15:12 -0800 <Edmullaa_> been saying it apple music &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; spotify

1501334640518316037 2022-03-08 15:10:46 -0800 <JAYQLO> おはようございます☀️  Appleのイベント観て、また寝ました。  二度寝です。  本日もよろしくお願いしますm(_ _)m  あなたにとって素敵な良い一日となりますように♪
1501334185826390021 2022-03-08 15:08:57 -0800 <brazildirector> @XXL Tell that to Apple who sells $1,000 phones.
1501334003172868108 2022-03-08 15:08:14 -0800 <theromanacosta> @Mr_Jack209 Apple better
1501333925695836167 2022-03-08 15:07:55 -0800 <JulianGray> @KindridOfficial Oh yeah ram is the killer haha. Apple rips you off for memory. My last Intel Mac mini I was able to upgrade it which was the only serviceable part.   This new m1 I just got the most I could afford upfront
1501333552666845187 2022-03-08 15:06:27 -0800 <lolschey> I want an Apple Watch sooo bad.
1501331760377778185 2022-03-08 14:59:19 -0800 <garccii68> Apple should have a new feature on the next airpods that have a small light that turns on while on the phone that way people don’t think you’re a weirdo talking to yourself
1501330775181910020 2022-03-08 14:55:24 -0800 <catherined247> spotify being down made me take advantage of my apple music free trial today, now that i've tried both i can confidently say i STILL think spotify is far superior.
1501330647767416832 2022-03-08 14:54:54 -0800 <LiLSwaG0779> @Chaitanya7483 @YT_Blockbuster @theramalmedia Then what differentiates iPad Air 5 and iPad Pro besides dual camera system if both got m1 chips and 120hz displays? Apple wants Promotion to be part of Pro lineup. Like newer MacBook pro, iPad Pro and iPhone Pro series. Regular iPhones didn't get 120hz so don't expect for Air 5
1501330567949795328 2022-03-08 14:54:35 -0800 <BrianCBock> @markgurman @davezatz This way Apple gets to sell the computer, monitor, keyboard, and trackpad individually instead of an all in one package.
1501330450819600391 2022-03-08 14:54:07 -0800 <modmodmodified> coffee was shit today, undrinkable phone calls have been shit today Apple Event was a snore fest I haven't even had lunch yet.  fuck today
1501330039542976517 2022-03-08 14:52:29 -0800 <natterdaze> @BCsoflol @Apple I don’t think you know what poverty is, if you’re calling  a $400+ luxury item a “poverty phone.” What an ignorant comment. Many can’t, or don’t feel it’s necessary to, spend over $1k on a cell phone that literally just needs to call and text.
1501330020974796807 2022-03-08 14:52:25 -0800 <unrgnlmiguel> @dmcgco Define ‘affordable’ in Apple standards plz
1501329749250957316 2022-03-08 14:51:20 -0800 <JustCeceTweets> @trvs_30 Why wouldn’t you? Sir, if you want an Apple Watch go get yourself one and wear it proudly ⌚️
1501329676693770249 2022-03-08 14:51:02 -0800 <shishujenn> Am I the only one that uses Apple Music 🧍🏼‍♀️
1501329311764148224 2022-03-08 14:49:35 -0800 <klw370> @jennyhuynh97 idk get Apple Music so you can listen in Atmos?
1501329248123899908 2022-03-08 14:49:20 -0800 <CarlosBitMe> It’s still SoundCloud &gt; Apple Music
1501329203278409733 2022-03-08 14:49:10 -0800 <CoolSensAsn66> @rpvee @rexroy501 I hope you have manage to transfer your playlists using Songshift. Apple music is ok I'm using Amazon music because they have 3 months free trial offer and I'm a prime subscriber.
1501328962084954114 2022-03-08 14:48:12 -0800 <JBowdacious> Some good stuff from @apple today, if you don’t already have an M1. Just recently picked up a new MacBook Pro so probably won’t be grabbing anything
1501328265914449920 2022-03-08 14:45:26 -0800 <TOTH_562> @kkoalalulu Spotify way better tf? You smoking good shit to be thinking Apple Music is better. Spotify has a way better user interface anyway
1501327819657285632 2022-03-08 14:43:40 -0800 <Engarneering> @yiningkarlli Heaven help you if apple wants the part you're waiting on.
1501327668423184387 2022-03-08 14:43:04 -0800 <ulisesmejiaaa> @mikelescobarr BOZO ALERT switch to apple
1501327525003206656 2022-03-08 14:42:29 -0800 <ThisPostLife> @jessekoepkecuts @Apple Like washing my car brings on the rain. I just got my maxed out m1 max MBP. You’re welcome! 😜Hopefully I’ll get a few years out of it. ;)

1501325912523952130 2022-03-08 14:36:05 -0800 <1980kcom> @dhof apple loves rugging it's customers
1501325550685671432 2022-03-08 14:34:39 -0800 <OpsThomaz> @AgenteAlcantara A Apple chutando a Intel junto com a amd
1501325470763085833 2022-03-08 14:34:20 -0800 <TheYoloGeek> Apple-level naming confusion: M1 Pro, M1 Ultra, and M1 Max. Which has the MAX power? M1 Ultra should have been named M1 Duo tbh #AppleEvent $aapl
1501325392992366594 2022-03-08 14:34:01 -0800 <cambam1963> @jaxajueny restarted my apple music subscription and damn i forgot how much better the sound quality is

1501323694324346882 2022-03-08 14:27:16 -0800 <caseyonfire> Great take @DonLagreca “Down in the hole” unplugged is amazing. Same with Rooster and Nutshell. Way better take then the Apple TV 😂 don’t hate me brother @TMKSESPN
1501323676687351808 2022-03-08 14:27:12 -0800 <TimIsenman> @davejacobseniOS Yeah, the last point is the pill you've got to swallow. Either pay the Apple premium or go for premium from like LG for half the price lol
1501323626733129730 2022-03-08 14:27:00 -0800 <theprettydemonn> apple needa make it so that we can play music and still be otp at the same time 😒 cus sometimes i wanna listen to my music but i still wanna be otp too .
1501322567423959041 2022-03-08 14:22:47 -0800 <ericjgrimm> @DankandHandsome Going to Apple Music was something because you realize how fucking bad the sound quality is on Spotify. Spotify does have better radio, though.
1501322447508762624 2022-03-08 14:22:19 -0800 <AmazingHealth8> @atheistic_1 @HARROBERTS He love His creation, but some of it doesn’t love Him… bad apples in the barrel.

1501318583531433993 2022-03-08 14:06:58 -0800 <vladyera> @davelanger2k @BILLPC2684 @Apple Um..no, M1, M1 Pro, M1 Ultra, M1 Max are basically the same chips with a different number of cores.  M1 Mac Mini is only 1.5 years old.  They don't update these macs every year (2012 - 2014 - 2018 - 2020).
1501318461649133570 2022-03-08 14:06:29 -0800 <pearlpm_> what a good day to have Apple Music 😌
1501318345450135552 2022-03-08 14:06:01 -0800 <TerryHan> A new “more affordable” iPhone for $429. Wow, Apple really is a company for the people
1501318278865514496 2022-03-08 14:05:45 -0800 <mandomando23> @princess_amigo No type situation like ewww Apple Music is ugly but like quality is so period fire
1501317594145456132 2022-03-08 14:03:02 -0800 <sthor97> me and my Apple Music account are feeling unbothered today

1501317077855981572 2022-03-08 14:00:59 -0800 <thisistechtoday> @schmanke 5K, hmmm might be rough or not the same kind of 5K that Apple is talking about. Ultrawide 5K.
1501317055685005319 2022-03-08 14:00:53 -0800 <itsaribitch> @Jiggly6 @jennatort i’m not gonna lie, i hate that you can’t follow artists &amp; the apple algorithm &amp; UI sucks in comparison, but it really is offensive to listen to music w spotify quality 🚮 not to mention all the other offensive shit they pull as a company
1501316954618875910 2022-03-08 14:00:29 -0800 <TherapistJayy> @Mo_Apple @Ms__E 😂😂😂😂 right
1501316878785941508 2022-03-08 14:00:11 -0800 <samanthalee_xo> I hate when my Apple Watch notifies me breathe… don’t tell me to breathe 😤😂
1501316784850227210 2022-03-08 13:59:49 -0800 <PastaVersaucy> If you cannot sit with the sound of your own unfiltered silence, then Bono is your option. Count your blessings even if they were added to your apple library without your consent
1501316586765905922 2022-03-08 13:59:02 -0800 <AndreElijah> @rje NO APPLE CARD IN CANADA BRO!!!!
1501315773712650245 2022-03-08 13:55:48 -0800 <PastaVersaucy> It’s fine if Spotify is ever down because I know I’ll always have one thing if it comes down to it, the Apple U2 album
1501315694805192706 2022-03-08 13:55:29 -0800 <IamNinetyFour> @MidwinterMakes there’s a joke to be had here about green and Apple, but that joke is too rich for me. Ha ha
1501315607245225984 2022-03-08 13:55:08 -0800 <real_Levinn> Spotify down?? Apple Music could never 👀
1501315578702688258 2022-03-08 13:55:01 -0800 <FernieCommaAlex> @lindsaykatai I'm so sick of Apple's planned obsolescence. My tiny man's knees are ALREADY breaking down and the guy at the genius bar said it'd just be cheaper to get a new tiny man.

1501314806191583232 2022-03-08 13:51:57 -0800 <jamilaalexis> apple bringing back the home button to the iphone se is absolutely sending me
1501314799291928577 2022-03-08 13:51:55 -0800 <afishershin> The way I thought Apple wouldn’t ever touch USB-A again
1501314572053008388 2022-03-08 13:51:01 -0800 <Utilisateur__75> @jnamtc Ouais ouais lol, j’ai tout eu, les AirPods Pro, le casque AirPods Max à 629€, l’iPad pro M1 qui est sorti cette année aussi… j’ai vraiment tout eu d’Apple j’suis un vrai client (pigeon).

1501312983170904065 2022-03-08 13:44:42 -0800 <itsfrankieiv> To @RealMichaelKay ‘s point - Apple TV exclusive does neglect older fans, but could this be an effort of baseball trying to appeal to younger fans who don’t use cable anymore? @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN @Rosenbergradio @AnthonyPucik

1501312265768763392 2022-03-08 13:41:51 -0800 <FrancesCoronel> The Dropout on Hulu, We Crashed on Apple TV, Super Pumped on ShowTime  Conflicted on all the attention these massive fails in tech are getting 🤔  But it does look entertaining... 🤭

1501311789329313793 2022-03-08 13:39:58 -0800 <retromike22> My lunch today was apple pie + chicken pot pie = π²
1501311520155717638 2022-03-08 13:38:54 -0800 <tristemepongo> clicked on the r&amp;b playlist that apple curated for women’s day and the first song on there was “i hate you” by sza lmaoo
1501311432213733383 2022-03-08 13:38:33 -0800 <itsyagirlfrank> not me jumping ship to Apple Music the second Spotify logged me out of my account of 10 years 😖😖🤚
1501311309408731136 2022-03-08 13:38:03 -0800 <_theluvdoc> Apple Music would never 😌
1501310913785204739 2022-03-08 13:36:29 -0800 <itsbymizu> @justedgar_ that is true, but I got downloaded music on Apple Music 🧠 always gotta have the back up
1501310797149917188 2022-03-08 13:36:01 -0800 <Droid_Andrew> Apple - $3999 M1 Ultra Mac Studio  PC- $3999 - AMD Threadripper + RTX3080Ti + multiple M.2 storage  The premium ask is still for MacOS. And... that's hard to justify given the performance difference.
1501310791236014080 2022-03-08 13:36:00 -0800 <MackMacTlksBack> @nicksterwixter @scaredycath @autienelle That and the old computer monitors were the absolute worst. When Apple made the candy color ones I finally knew a smidge of peace in computer labs.

1501310380726841352 2022-03-08 13:34:22 -0800 <andykhouri> Today’s Apple event: I appreciate learning about how chips work but I wonder how many people like these long presentations about silicon and thermals etc.
1501310049586757636 2022-03-08 13:33:03 -0800 <yiningkarlli> Everybody in tech: sorry we can’t make X right now because chip shortage. Apple: We put an entire iPhone in the Studio Display, what chip shortage?
1501310021098819588 2022-03-08 13:32:56 -0800 <moveimgaay> @BlaykePhillips Same! Lol. I was like let me go switch to Apple Music haha
1501309659671511042 2022-03-08 13:31:30 -0800 <freddyscott> the day after my M1 max MacBook Pro arrives apple announces the M1 ultra. What’s next, other new stuff?!

1501308717471395840 2022-03-08 13:27:45 -0800 <jacksonjroyal> i don’t care which platforms y’all prefer... but just know that ya homies that make music get paid more from Apple Music as opposed to Spotify. food for thots... i mean.. yeah.
1501308637842575360 2022-03-08 13:27:26 -0800 <roycifer> @Algoriddim tell your buddies at @apple to let djay integrate with @applemusic  🤠
1501308486163972096 2022-03-08 13:26:50 -0800 <yuusharo> @kiliman @ShahriarFahim_ @reneritchie Apple has lots of clever engineers. Sure, it wouldn’t work in the current iMac design, but a new design centered around M1 Ultra is absolutely feasible.  iMac Pro is definitely coming, says my money.
1501307843424653314 2022-03-08 13:24:17 -0800 <alexmoto> @benz145 Upgrade eyeballs to iBalls Pro @Apple
1501307838290743302 2022-03-08 13:24:16 -0800 <afishershin> I can’t believe Apple released yet another iPhone 8
1501307818443378692 2022-03-08 13:24:11 -0800 <BDavisCollins> The free Apple Music subscription just started charging me on the same day that this Spotify crash is going on… clearly my membership is very valuable and these companies will stop at nothing to have me
1501307565308887040 2022-03-08 13:23:11 -0800 <Shoot_The_Noise> This song and others from Lee's current album “Ghost Stories" feature gorgeous strings by renowned composer/cellist @daveeggar (Coldplay, H.E.R., Fiona Apple &amp; many more).   If you haven’t heard “Ghost Stories”, hit us up for more songs from this exceptional LP...
1501307384827768832 2022-03-08 13:22:28 -0800 <afishershin> The benefit of watching the #AppleEvent afterward is skipping through the Apple TV+ ads lollll
1501307260730961920 2022-03-08 13:21:58 -0800 <Diannaa789> @LazcanoAnnmarie Time to switch to Apple Music bestie 💅🏼
1501306690557267969 2022-03-08 13:19:42 -0800 <dawn_yuuki> Does no one understand that if you have a misunderstanding, that repeating the exact same thing you said to cause the misunderstanding isnt going to change anything???  If you say "do you want an apple" and I say whats that. You saying "its an apple" wont clarify shit
1501306543253311490 2022-03-08 13:19:07 -0800 <max135able> @briskaliciouss Can’t relate, I use Apple Music 🥴
1501306536022319105 2022-03-08 13:19:05 -0800 <SloanWorkshop> @lichunan @danedeasy @marcoarment It never hurts to ask especially if you are buying an Apple product instead

1501305670653538308 2022-03-08 13:15:39 -0800 <jeffersongraham> Would you fork over $10,000 (with tax and Apple Care) for a new loaded Mac (Studio)? I'd love to have a speedier Mac, but gosh, that is so pricey.
1501305637048750083 2022-03-08 13:15:31 -0800 <VinnyViper> Spotify shutting their shit down just to show Apple Music we not moving over

1501305210265690114 2022-03-08 13:13:49 -0800 <C_Lepkowski> @webxracademy Supporting AR in mobile browsers would be a huge, obvious, and immediate win for both developers and consumers, and it’s been within Apple’s reach for a long time—IMO, as long as they continue this sabotage, it’s too generous to say they’re “shipping WebXR”.

1501303143224782856 2022-03-08 13:05:36 -0800 <isarahtonin> Forgot that I had a free trial for Apple Music and I’m finally giving it a try since Spotify wants to be slacking. It won’t be the same considering I have like a decade worth of music saved on Spotify
1501302935766011911 2022-03-08 13:04:47 -0800 <BnPBrooks> Apple podcasts automatically redownloaded itself on my phone two days before Spotify crashes? 🤔🤔
1501302759882051585 2022-03-08 13:04:05 -0800 <reginalmao> never gonna touch apple music again but i had to listen to music

1501302494009327619 2022-03-08 13:03:02 -0800 <gnomaroma> Seems like Apple should have figured out a better way to rearrange apps by now
1501302316539936769 2022-03-08 13:02:19 -0800 <LuissHidalgo> Why is it every time I buy an Apple product something newer comes out!? Smh😂😂🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️

1501301199865143298 2022-03-08 12:57:53 -0800 <lafcjulio> Spotify is down? *laughs in Apple music* 😂
1501301152712855554 2022-03-08 12:57:42 -0800 <karlayaniraa> regardless of spotify tweaking today it baffles me that people still have apple music in 2022
1501301137571340288 2022-03-08 12:57:38 -0800 <yaboychizzy> did they hack Spotify or nah? we should all be using Apple Music or Tidal anyway
1501300977831333889 2022-03-08 12:57:00 -0800 <drugproblem> @SpeakNowShannen wait same i grew up downloading my own songs and exclusively using itunes but apple music just isn’t the same. spotify is a lot more user friendly
1501300698624917507 2022-03-08 12:55:54 -0800 <benjamiller> @sszwiec Apparently it's two exclusive games on Fridays. Not sure if that's every Friday. So, if a Brewers game gets chosen, then you'd have to have Apple TV+ to be able to watch.

1501298993954910210 2022-03-08 12:49:07 -0800 <ChampsPapa1015> @Patrick_ONeal They made a deal…w/Apple Tv 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
1501298866167054338 2022-03-08 12:48:37 -0800 <JPEGJustice> Apple Music doing numbers 😌
1501298404940386306 2022-03-08 12:46:47 -0800 <ryansatin> @Bullseye_wb Apple Podcasts...
1501298131442417664 2022-03-08 12:45:41 -0800 <yvng_angell> good day to have Apple Music
1501297941650149378 2022-03-08 12:44:56 -0800 <staceyyh_> Spotify being down made me go back to Apple Music 💔
1501297557611319296 2022-03-08 12:43:25 -0800 <beMOTION_dESIGN> @eyedesyn @FakeGreenDress @AdobeAE @MaxonVFX @Apple And Larissa from @borisfx!!
1501297372264951811 2022-03-08 12:42:40 -0800 <Dion_o4o6> @YourManAdrian Why not Apple Music ?? You have iPhone ? Is it really that bad ? 😬
1501297343336894464 2022-03-08 12:42:34 -0800 <RyanTroutSays> Spotify crashing during the Apple event makes me want to believe in corporate hackers.
1501297330942660611 2022-03-08 12:42:31 -0800 <ryannelson> Apple Studio Display still only 27"? Ha! Long Live the 30"!!
1501297063954247685 2022-03-08 12:41:27 -0800 <CarterScores> @kingsofthepod @mayorNHL I listen on Apple Podcasts. You’re welcome. 😁😅
1501296999622004737 2022-03-08 12:41:12 -0800 <ThrasherDan> I could feed a small country with the amount I spent on Apple products today.
1501296871217655810 2022-03-08 12:40:41 -0800 <fuckyoureno> Apple Music would never but okay
1501296830725779462 2022-03-08 12:40:31 -0800 <EmilieWhitehea5> @Apple Geez, what, do they release these every few days or what?
1501296784643031043 2022-03-08 12:40:20 -0800 <eric_klx> @chanelisthatyou Hence why Apple superior
1501296642326089732 2022-03-08 12:39:46 -0800 <qt_Mute> @YoThatsImpct Apple Music&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
1501296484255289346 2022-03-08 12:39:09 -0800 <danajamesjones> Apple, all I wanted was a new iMac "Pro" and you give me a new monitor and the "Mac Studio" (an updated version of their Mac Mini) and you'll obviously need both so at the cheapest that'll be $3,600. Oof...
1501296424998223877 2022-03-08 12:38:55 -0800 <iTzTONIC> not me getting to work &amp; realizing i left my apple watch in my room and an airpod in the bathroom!!!! 😤
1501296195561422848 2022-03-08 12:38:00 -0800 <darkmanx2g> @TheGalox_ The iPhone 11 is a way better deal at $499 in the apple store.
1501295752714219529 2022-03-08 12:36:14 -0800 <TherapistJayy> @Ms__E @Mo_Apple Like a lot lmao 🤣
1501295597420105728 2022-03-08 12:35:37 -0800 <revelionart> saw some of my poster art at the Apple event today 👀
1501294908799275009 2022-03-08 12:32:53 -0800 <kaelinwilliamss> Apple has really been putting in work with these mac lineups. for a while it looked like they were only focused on mobiles (ipads,phones, watches,etc) so its cute seeing their focus go back to computers🥺 #AppleEvent
1501294794580000769 2022-03-08 12:32:26 -0800 <Jeremyyzzg> Y tf apple couldn’t release the green iPhone when they released the iPhone 13
1501294777169440772 2022-03-08 12:32:22 -0800 <KyleMarcelino> Using the “Free Trial” for Apple music. Desperate times, call for desperate measures.
1501294491289849858 2022-03-08 12:31:14 -0800 <redturn2> @BizballMaury @TKREFRESH22 How much money is the Apple TV deal worth??
1501294189874753545 2022-03-08 12:30:02 -0800 <glutenqueen> No me digan que se cayó spotify la puta madre y justo cancelé apple music y no tengo na'. MEVOAMATAR
1501294107775307780 2022-03-08 12:29:42 -0800 <DiHuang> Think I'll head on over to the Apple store next Friday. See if they have it.
1501294000774389763 2022-03-08 12:29:17 -0800 <Utilisateur__75> @jnamtc Écoute j’ai apple watch 7 en bleu le 13 pro Max en bleu alpin le dernier iMac en bleu… Donc si ça sort tu connais la couleur lol.
1501293922701570053 2022-03-08 12:28:58 -0800 <kherge> I take all of it back. I had trouble understanding the difference between the 1st and 2nd GPU graphs they showed in the keynote. Now, I eagerly await independent testing to understand what Apple means by performance. If it's comparable rasterization performance, this is nuts.
1501293608330153987 2022-03-08 12:27:43 -0800 <dani011309> @bladesptt apple music
1501293566181580808 2022-03-08 12:27:33 -0800 <kevinlum> @averagejoelle @Spotify What about the U2 album compliments of Apple. That damn thing still randomly plays.
1501293540961243136 2022-03-08 12:27:27 -0800 <TherapistJayy> @Mo_Apple Lmfaoooo make it make sense chile I get it’s more convenient but come on 😩😩😩
1501293480823320579 2022-03-08 12:27:13 -0800 <CreativeTVMinds> @Dranksty_Janx Wouldn’t know since I switch to Apple Music as my main music player 👀.
1501293452776165382 2022-03-08 12:27:06 -0800 <visnsofbillions> worked on some layout for apple news that go live Friday 😲
1501293291299487747 2022-03-08 12:26:27 -0800 <IsaacWilliamYoo> @KillahhhhMelohh @bigcheesecake12 He uses Apple Music 🤮
1501292904156782594 2022-03-08 12:24:55 -0800 <marketinvestr> @WholeMarsBlog Apple rocks!!! That desktop computer is friggin awesome. What’s there not to love?
1501292349443362818 2022-03-08 12:22:43 -0800 <adamj_griff> Does anybody else have an issue with their Apple Watch disconnecting their AirPods whenever they close the exercise ring/get a notification?
1501291974040571908 2022-03-08 12:21:13 -0800 <imcharlie_b> Hey @apple, next time make that iPhone color available at the initial model launch Kthanks
1501291843497168899 2022-03-08 12:20:42 -0800 <bbchxn> @DavidRoscero A good day to be an Apple Music user 😮‍💨
1501291650353614849 2022-03-08 12:19:56 -0800 <madamlebowski> @jacklikesdogs Apple Music users being classist? Wasn’t aware degeneracy was a class.
1501291532116127744 2022-03-08 12:19:28 -0800 <littleblackxfox> @ariekawakami LOLLLL I’m an avid Apple Music user 😂
1501291465573498881 2022-03-08 12:19:12 -0800 <orbitingsunn> @youtubemusic is on that @AppleMusic bs... playing music automatically without the setting to turn off that function. &amp; now somehow I'm getting music to start playing that I don't even listen to. Shouldn't even be in there based upon algorithms 😅
1501291068603592706 2022-03-08 12:17:38 -0800 <StrictlyNickley> Apple Music users have been waiting for this day all their lives. And that says something.
1501290672950632448 2022-03-08 12:16:03 -0800 <handleym99> @Volto_v_Black @marcan42 OR the box is designed to last a few years (as Apple box designs are) and in a year or two the M2/m3 Ultra will come with four chiplets?
1501290451390775303 2022-03-08 12:15:10 -0800 <waynesworld> So I’m guessing the A13 powered @Apple #studiodisplay runs iOS?
1501290371761860608 2022-03-08 12:14:51 -0800 <thisistechtoday> Interesting realization:  Apple only gave us a single color option for the Mac Studio and Studio display.  #AppleEvent  #MacStudio
1501290350761050114 2022-03-08 12:14:46 -0800 <dannykrall> @TheAppleCircle think @Apple will release a black non-numeric magic keyboard?
1501290323477250055 2022-03-08 12:14:40 -0800 <JilianneParker> @GO_GO_ELECTRIC @Apple They make more than phones.
1501290306267799559 2022-03-08 12:14:36 -0800 <johana95> Oop did I miss the Apple event
1501290282368712705 2022-03-08 12:14:30 -0800 <DaisyEagan> Person on Apple podcasts wonders what I'm doing about bettering the world aside from being snarky about it on my podcast. Literally four decades of raising money and awareness for causes that better the world...
1501290157701435393 2022-03-08 12:14:00 -0800 <OtarikCom> Даже презентацию apple не видел
1501290070799568896 2022-03-08 12:13:40 -0800 <charbinks> @dsantana310 Yeah I work for Apple and even though im pro Appoe everything usually , I do really like Spotify. Specifically for those curated playlists .
1501289889224138758 2022-03-08 12:12:56 -0800 <TheHighburyEra> This Spotify issue is jarring man might switch to Apple Music
1501289739202093061 2022-03-08 12:12:21 -0800 <jersonalvarado_> Apple Music &gt;
1501289694625075201 2022-03-08 12:12:10 -0800 <jersonalvarado_> I’ve always loved Apple Music 🙏
1501289632062787585 2022-03-08 12:11:55 -0800 <handleym99> @neilcybart Well in a sense it required Apple to walk back from "monitors are commodity, we won't make them". Much of buying an iMac Pro was buying the monitor.  Next step, Apple walks back from "WiFi base stations are a commodity, we won't make them"? Oh please, oh please!!!
1501289597577228288 2022-03-08 12:11:47 -0800 <io_chami> @4Barel @MichaelETenner @BenGeskin So if you were the one making the decision for Apple / western companies, would you rather they not virtue signal?
1501289506401447937 2022-03-08 12:11:25 -0800 <ophirbk> @notmrmanziel What about Apple?
1501289497698332676 2022-03-08 12:11:23 -0800 <AReastofthe405> @BillShaikin I have Apple + and it's only $4.99/mo and great programming. However I don't like the move for MLB. If they want more viewers put it on a Big 3 broadcast network.
1501289457445650437 2022-03-08 12:11:13 -0800 <alxbtnd> Étant donnez que je travaille dans un Apple Store ils ont des technique de vente unique au monde
1501289447962206212 2022-03-08 12:11:11 -0800 <Jayy02__> Apple Music&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
1501289391917965318 2022-03-08 12:10:58 -0800 <Chraplord> Apple Music rn 👺
1501289385584517120 2022-03-08 12:10:56 -0800 <preskill> @JayWacker @KyleCranmer What, you are "part of Apple"?
1501289286770913284 2022-03-08 12:10:33 -0800 <RAHERDI21> @adrianpiedracr Apple Music paps.
1501288825217163266 2022-03-08 12:08:43 -0800 <RiT_Luis> @dettywaaap I just logged back in, I was about to start my free trial of Apple Music lmao
1501288736281468928 2022-03-08 12:08:21 -0800 <PeteRosen3> @Josh_Moon Apples and orangutans. Congressmen “betting” in your example benefits only themselves and maybe a couple cronies. Players betting could undermine the integrity of the entire NFL. Cannot be allowed. And I believe the NFL is as bad as congress in their decision making.
1501288710339395585 2022-03-08 12:08:15 -0800 <BGyss> Imagine a Beowulf cluster of Apple Studio Displays @_photex_ lol
1501288241709780994 2022-03-08 12:06:24 -0800 <djrosegoldto> @TheLastArtful @AppleMusic Omg thank you so much 🥺
1501288035551350785 2022-03-08 12:05:34 -0800 <Gigii_024> @desty_hunn And that’s why I’m Apple Music
1501287982434856972 2022-03-08 12:05:22 -0800 <Zaros17560582> @BrandonLKS Par contre @BrandonLKS  j'ai du mal a comprendre le move d'Apple avec l'Ipad Air 5 vs L'ipad Pro 11"   Même puce, même quantité de ram  En dehors de l'écran et de la capacité de stockage et module photo..   Pourquoi il font marcher le Air 5 sur les plate bande du Pro 11 ? ...
1501287850452549632 2022-03-08 12:04:50 -0800 <badvvitch666> Just wanna be annoying and say Apple Music up 10 points today 😂😅
1501287755459878917 2022-03-08 12:04:28 -0800 <tokyomegaplex> @Oddernod Yeah I can’t imagine it’s really actually modular beyond the way you configure displays. We are back to the classic apple black box situation, which is a fair trade-off esp now with their custom chips imo. It looks good tho!
1501287708714491906 2022-03-08 12:04:16 -0800 <Scoot_Mescudi> @Apple Apple reklam verme bundan sonra aq kimse alamaz bundan sonra
1501287351431036928 2022-03-08 12:02:51 -0800 <charbinks> @dsantana310 I can admit that Spotify is pretty elite but I get Apple Music fa free and Spotify tryna take my money lol
1501287271248531456 2022-03-08 12:02:32 -0800 <quentinfontaa> this spotify shit got me on the apple music radio during school 😩
1501287263832981510 2022-03-08 12:02:30 -0800 <whothefuckisJ0E> @SnazzyQ  Crazy idea for a project but hear me out- what if you got the Apple keyboard with Touch ID and turned it into a wireless Touch ID button? Cut the board etc while somehow keeping the Bluetooth connectivity intact all in a new case. Would be the best Mac desktop accessory
1501287076058124290 2022-03-08 12:01:46 -0800 <MNylrem> @ChelseaChaosSL You want apple, cranberry or grape? I know orange juice makes your tum tum feel bad.
1501287019481161729 2022-03-08 12:01:32 -0800 <itsnoahluv> Apple Music always comes in handy in the long run tho
1501286954234572805 2022-03-08 12:01:17 -0800 <yslbrandon__> spotify is beans lmao, apple music on top
1501286944428359681 2022-03-08 12:01:14 -0800 <ChrisAlex__> Apple music &gt;&gt;&gt;
1501286595164467202 2022-03-08 11:59:51 -0800 <ggIzento> @phsidefender Apple has some of the highest profit margins in the entire world for any company; in other words, they are ripping people off at a ridiculous scale. They also have the highest brand value of any company.
1501286586255740929 2022-03-08 11:59:49 -0800 <isnotkarla> Idc i still have Apple Music
1501286566194343936 2022-03-08 11:59:44 -0800 <EtemSomaya> @hamids @Apple Their mouse is definitely the most inconvenient device they ever created
1501286544312705024 2022-03-08 11:59:39 -0800 <stoladev> Apple event was meh. Expectations were too high when I heard “they’re revealing new hardware”. Was hoping for some iGlasses tbh
1501286455888384000 2022-03-08 11:59:18 -0800 <lidiaisabell> @agghhjenny I just purchased Apple Music cause i thot Spotify was only tripping out for me and now it’s working gua Que creisi
1501286444190420993 2022-03-08 11:59:15 -0800 <kherge> I think the veneer Apple puts on all of their keynotes has finally worn off for me. It used to be fun to watch when they offered truly interesting products, but now it feels more like it is being used to hide shortcomings.
1501286407712641026 2022-03-08 11:59:06 -0800 <ChristianGlawe> Hate to say it, gang, but this looks like EOL for iMac/iMac Pro configs... #Apple have broken apart the machine from the 5k display - probably for good. #AppleEvent
1501286135275741186 2022-03-08 11:58:01 -0800 <ThornsPerfected> Apple Music continuing to prove its superiority for like the third time this year
1501286048579702789 2022-03-08 11:57:41 -0800 <JUANSOICYY> This is why Apple Music remains the supreme
1501285922649743361 2022-03-08 11:57:11 -0800 <Mixbrick> @MoonOverlord Apple master race
1501285624355037186 2022-03-08 11:56:00 -0800 <nicopena24> Bananas&gt;apples
1501285618621558786 2022-03-08 11:55:58 -0800 <KipStedwell> So nobody is gonna tell apple to calm tf down? At all? This new Mac is FUCKING RIDICULOUS and almost makes me want to be an apple user
1501285567257985033 2022-03-08 11:55:46 -0800 <g0the_> Spotify is down so I luckily have a week of free Apple Music or whatever hehehe
1501285471653031937 2022-03-08 11:55:23 -0800 <charbinks> All you Spotify users all stressed today…. Apple Music could never 😂😂
1501285308943331330 2022-03-08 11:54:44 -0800 <g_colbs98> @clairecatlin It’s the U2 album that I didn’t ask for that is STILL on my Apple Music that is getting me
1501285297837023235 2022-03-08 11:54:42 -0800 <xTheRealAndresr> Wow. Apple with a bomb-shell. AppleProRaw! #AppleEvent
1501285245106020357 2022-03-08 11:54:29 -0800 <TheHndrx> Based on my TL after today’s Apple event it seems like Intel is headed for bankruptcy 😂
1501284968651116545 2022-03-08 11:53:23 -0800 <AC_M0NEY> Apple Music&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
1501284907921723395 2022-03-08 11:53:09 -0800 <RyanCalavano> @LOrangeMusic oh god. Apple??? I was looking to trade in my Macbook and their offer was ridiculously low.
1501284836245327872 2022-03-08 11:52:52 -0800 <xbyfrndmaterial> @saggybabby I’m Apple. But my desktop version at my desk is alive and well
1501284338549202951 2022-03-08 11:50:53 -0800 <cambam1963> if @Spotify isnt up in a damn hour i’m switching to @AppleMusic
1501284152661843975 2022-03-08 11:50:09 -0800 <i_kingt> Apple does it again
1501283991999049729 2022-03-08 11:49:30 -0800 <xoettevy> Apple Music would never crash on me 🤷🏽‍♀️ JS
1501283922189062144 2022-03-08 11:49:14 -0800 <lamip218> @jon_prosser The tech gap between intel and apple is huge now.
1501283785685438467 2022-03-08 11:48:41 -0800 <inventmattt> Idc if Spotify is down for a week there’s no chance on this green planet I’m opening the Apple Music app
1501283765770809345 2022-03-08 11:48:36 -0800 <wifistoken> Barley a month into moving to Spotify and now the app is down, Apple Music is goated
1501283631225970688 2022-03-08 11:48:04 -0800 <kherge> Apple compared their unified GPU in M1 Ultra to a RTX 3060 Ti in terms of performance, and an RTX 3090 in terms of power consumption. That is pretty bad.
1501283612863315969 2022-03-08 11:48:00 -0800 <dezpensive> Apple Music users all lmaoooo-y now huh
1501283434676711425 2022-03-08 11:47:17 -0800 <AAnduve> Apple Music would never.
1501283370747105280 2022-03-08 11:47:02 -0800 <DiHuang> I still have the $100 Apple gift card from buying a Mac mini for my parents to use.
1501283324945256448 2022-03-08 11:46:51 -0800 <mmunoz_17> Spotify is down time to jump onto my Apple Music lmao
1501283265356787715 2022-03-08 11:46:37 -0800 <zanyama_> Apple ฉลาดมากนะ ที่เอา M1 มาลง iPad Air   มี Reputation เรื่องความแรง แล้วยิ่งมีแมค ไอแพดโปร อยู่ในไลน์อัพนี้อยู่แล้ว การผลิตชิพออกมาในปริมาณมากแล้วแอพพลายเข้าทุกโปรดักก็คือช่วยประหยัดต้นทุนมากๆ เลย #AppleEvent
1501283175196073990 2022-03-08 11:46:16 -0800 <superbryntendo> Apple sets
1501283150462427137 2022-03-08 11:46:10 -0800 <mattjannes> Mannen van apple music winnen ook eens een keertje🤣
1501283086704594944 2022-03-08 11:45:55 -0800 <mikepepemusic> New Mac Studio products looks very incredible. Apple continues to revolutionize the computing space with their M-Series chips. Just awesome. However I do think it’s about time for them to start including baseline 1tb of storage. Silly the baseline has 32gb of RAM but 512gd ssd.
1501283085102436352 2022-03-08 11:45:54 -0800 <JotyKay> @IAMDJREMINISCE Apple Music
1501283071760293888 2022-03-08 11:45:51 -0800 <thebenpatterson> @pkafka Feels like nfl makes more syndicating Sunday ticket and red zone than selling to one. Amazon, apple, Netflix, YouTube, directv, dish all could pay in aggregate more
1501282998607437827 2022-03-08 11:45:34 -0800 <lilhuesos0212> It’s a good day to have Apple Music
1501282867912925186 2022-03-08 11:45:02 -0800 <Tophrrr> Hmm? Oh I'm sorry I couldn't hear you over my Apple Music
1501282815752564737 2022-03-08 11:44:50 -0800 <jaazzyy__faaayy> @uhhahahah No mine is too! I had to go but Apple Music again 😭😭
1501282785448714240 2022-03-08 11:44:43 -0800 <Jesse11____> @dreah_23 No lie apple be playing removing songs.. been considering Spotify for a min
1501282767149043715 2022-03-08 11:44:38 -0800 <marianaisback> i have both Spotify and Apple Music.. hehehe y’all be easy
1501282764557103106 2022-03-08 11:44:38 -0800 <Ericjm1218> Of course when i switch from apple music to spotifythis happens wtf
1501282546167910401 2022-03-08 11:43:46 -0800 <vanessssaaaa__> Now all y’all Apple Music shit talkers ain’t saying anything huh 🤔
1501282432867135491 2022-03-08 11:43:19 -0800 <JWaldman88> Again, Apple Music &gt;&gt;&gt; Spotify
1501282408775127044 2022-03-08 11:43:13 -0800 <iPhonedo> @every_daydad Only thing outdated is this reaction.  This is a device for specific people, for specific market. It is a very clever way to bring people to Apple ecosystem. You're not just gettin the phone, you're getting their services too. And for some people that's enough.  It is brilliant.
1501282260632227850 2022-03-08 11:42:38 -0800 <751bklyn> So @Apple took away features that everyone needed. Go add them back one by one then to have them all again but this time charging tons
1501282248921812997 2022-03-08 11:42:35 -0800 <DarthZaber03> Apple Music gang 🍎, everyone freakin out gmfu 💀 shits hilarious
1501282221847560201 2022-03-08 11:42:28 -0800 <Pop0Twin2> @Apple kept saying “game changer” in their keynote. I wonder if they are hinting on a gaming platform. With all their new chips, why not.
1501281942318174213 2022-03-08 11:41:22 -0800 <EddygleZ42> #QueenRadio Nicki why are you moving from Apple Music to this new platform?

1501281774965461004 2022-03-08 11:40:42 -0800 <eddy_bryant> @AppleMusic squad where we at ?? Check in! 😬
1501281704702451719 2022-03-08 11:40:25 -0800 <Eonthecat> @Leon_SpottyDog The UI sucks but once you get used to it its not that bad. Def took me a couple of days to warm up to apple music.
1501281412539846657 2022-03-08 11:39:15 -0800 <rango_eryq> spotify is down so finally using the free 6 months of apple music i got with my airpods in november
1501281248358055946 2022-03-08 11:38:36 -0800 <KipStedwell> @JiggityJFraizzy @Apple You misunderstand me I would like to see how much better the A15 is than like the iPhone 12 not the iPhone 8
1501281214119833602 2022-03-08 11:38:28 -0800 <MarkSingerSays> @ericcoreyfreed @Apple You're adorable.
1501281007710126080 2022-03-08 11:37:39 -0800 <andrewblegh> Being back on Apple Music after years is a huge ass throwback
1501280993356902409 2022-03-08 11:37:35 -0800 <angieeem0> Spotify better get there shit together because I am not using ghetto ass Apple Music
1501280946057744384 2022-03-08 11:37:24 -0800 <TheDJF> 2022 was not the year for me to switch from @AppleMusic to @Spotify 😒
1501280914550124548 2022-03-08 11:37:17 -0800 <saldinez> Sooooooo the iPhone SE 3rd Gen doesn’t have CDMA? According to Apple’s compare page
1501280741648261131 2022-03-08 11:36:35 -0800 <yuusharo> @sharding @markgurman You may be underestimating the value of it being an all-in-one. That’s a big deal for some customers.  A bigger iMac also can mean beefier cooling, allowing a rumored quad Apple Silicon chip to fit at with a better display (mini-LED, 120hz, etc)
1501280569316966402 2022-03-08 11:35:54 -0800 <matthewluis_22> @omlbreee Apple Music could never
1501280540095234049 2022-03-08 11:35:47 -0800 <iamVegan96> @vexavexa_ Just get on Apple Music lmao
1501280336260468737 2022-03-08 11:34:59 -0800 <_nopalito> Apple Music isn’t down tho, feeling blessed 😌👆🏼✨💖💖💖
1501280045729415171 2022-03-08 11:33:49 -0800 <dimitribouniol> Watching ship dates slip to May as apple’s business site still refuses to load is painful 🥲
1501280038691303426 2022-03-08 11:33:48 -0800 <siryoulookhi> @dirtydvnn Apple Music gang &gt;&gt;&gt;
1501279940817264647 2022-03-08 11:33:24 -0800 <OscarOsorioM> Me toca utilizar Apple Music por primera vez🤮
1501279933334646785 2022-03-08 11:33:23 -0800 <JeremySchumann> @TheAtomRay Feels like an Apple move 🤔 #AppleEvent
1501279703814094848 2022-03-08 11:32:28 -0800 <751bklyn> I see @Apple picked violence today
1501279657458556935 2022-03-08 11:32:17 -0800 <markgurman> “Friday Night Baseball” will be available on Apple TV+ — and, for a limited time, &gt;&gt;&gt;without the need for a subscription.&lt;&lt;&lt;
1501279418420903940 2022-03-08 11:31:20 -0800 <shutupjonnn> Today, I love being an Apple Music person
1501279399672365057 2022-03-08 11:31:15 -0800 <HeyBoris> @jkeats So it's a Bad Apple?
1501279308882460672 2022-03-08 11:30:54 -0800 <taylororear> Apple Music didn’t crash
1501279276351385603 2022-03-08 11:30:46 -0800 <herb_just_herb> At the end of Apple’s hour-long event, I so wanted to hear Tim say, “Oh, and there’s one more thing…”  But…I was sadly disappointed.
1501279246328733699 2022-03-08 11:30:39 -0800 <KipStedwell> Apple is throwing the m1 chip into the iPad Air for the sole purpose of trying to dump on the tab S8 from Samsung. .   ....... and it might be working
1501279148924280838 2022-03-08 11:30:16 -0800 <SleezeMaraj> Apple cut the check! I need ALL THIS money!
1501279148907585537 2022-03-08 11:30:16 -0800 <GhosstXO> Suddenly apple music looks better than Spotify
1501279112542916608 2022-03-08 11:30:07 -0800 <1youngdji> apple music could never be in the mud like this
1501279108835254274 2022-03-08 11:30:06 -0800 <konstapelmeme88> Sygyttt att ha Apple Music 😂😂
1501279073737355267 2022-03-08 11:29:58 -0800 <GhosstXO> @KanyePodcast @AppleMusic I thought i was the only one
1501279068049735680 2022-03-08 11:29:56 -0800 <_gmartinez_> Enjoying my Apple Music on this fine day 😌
1501278952584851465 2022-03-08 11:29:29 -0800 <Cue_Aluta> @just_apples @Tay_Dlamini So edgy🤣
1501278739790893058 2022-03-08 11:28:38 -0800 <TandemOcean> Good thing for Spotify I use Apple Music too
1501278713647812611 2022-03-08 11:28:32 -0800 <Darchmare> @colincornaby I'm just happy that, with that mention, they've saved several hours of unnecessary commentary on a handful of Apple/tech podcasts I listen to.
1501278696702763010 2022-03-08 11:28:28 -0800 <simpboicarti> @graacieela *laughs in apple music*
1501278601043275777 2022-03-08 11:28:05 -0800 <slut4mrchalamet> Yes. Yes I did in fact get Apple Music using a 2month free trial only because Spotify is down. Yes it was that important for me to listen to music while driving. Yes I will be going back to Spotify the second it starts wokring again.
1501278550699040777 2022-03-08 11:27:53 -0800 <aejohnyy> @jventuriii @1_luissss Y’all suck apple dick alr
1501278480738095104 2022-03-08 11:27:36 -0800 <nellysimao_> Apple Music radios are playing only Music made by women today.
1501278420583387136 2022-03-08 11:27:22 -0800 <benjamiller> MLB deal will have zero impact on getting me to consider Apple TV+. I get more baseball than I want or need w/ MLB TV. I can miss the occasional Friday night Brewers game.
1501278412211568647 2022-03-08 11:27:20 -0800 <Veronic52901821> @Eliza_azilea @raffyyzz Me too!! @Spotify has my money but logged me out and won’t let me back in…even their online chat doesn’t respond:..guess I’ll cancel and only use Apple …sad!!!!!
1501278375494619136 2022-03-08 11:27:11 -0800 <RodKim> @ZackJamesOBZ Not that it’s necessarily related, but it’s funny that the Apple Keynote started and moments later Spotify and Discord went down. Then as Tim Cook closed the keynote, Spotify logged me back in 😂 still no Discord though.
1501278208573906944 2022-03-08 11:26:31 -0800 <PincheNunu> For once Apple Music is superior
1501278189728845825 2022-03-08 11:26:27 -0800 <carleighshepard> At least I don’t use Spotify too. Apple Music all the way baby
1501278156166029319 2022-03-08 11:26:19 -0800 <yuusharo> @film_girl I’m gonna guess it will be locked to 4k resolution. Apple’s 5K displays never went full size on Windows.  I’d love to hear how that plays out tho!! Might still look great for a gaming display if you can hot swap with thunderbolt
1501278067573940230 2022-03-08 11:25:58 -0800 <Cruxifyx_> Spotify ain workin? Good thing my dumbass pays for Apple Music too 🥱
1501277969720905732 2022-03-08 11:25:35 -0800 <imAnnaMolly> I have apple music 🧍🏻‍♀️
1501277965090377729 2022-03-08 11:25:33 -0800 <GabbieSosa11> Esto del Spotify está como cuando se cayo WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook. Una vez punto para Apple 😂😂😂
1501277909461266434 2022-03-08 11:25:20 -0800 <KjellRules> @kyliesparks Remains to be seen but my guess is Apple will make those games free (like YT did this year for the games on its service)
1501277854381740034 2022-03-08 11:25:07 -0800 <esp83> @Dreyahhh12 Apple Music &gt;
1501277810530258947 2022-03-08 11:24:57 -0800 <mxurooo> Good day to be an Apple Music user 😮‍💨
1501277803253166083 2022-03-08 11:24:55 -0800 <AshleyEsqueda> (I can't imagine Apple will allow that business name to continue, but maybe I'm wrong!)
1501277708768067594 2022-03-08 11:24:32 -0800 <shaman_kidd> @notingtobeseen yea no apple music is trash
1501277685787463680 2022-03-08 11:24:27 -0800 <AshleyEsqueda> @EvoAnubis Feeling for them because they named their business with absolutely no idea Apple would use it for a product line
1501277535253905409 2022-03-08 11:23:51 -0800 <b_rebel_> me *an apple music user, laughing at all you with spotify
1501277461107122181 2022-03-08 11:23:33 -0800 <matheuslesser_> o spotify não fez eu assinar a apple music não né
1501277424717340686 2022-03-08 11:23:25 -0800 <markgurman> Does not appear that Apple is keeping the old iPhone SE around at a lower price. A missed opportunity, in my opinion. Carriers and resellers I’m sure will have a field day though with it.
1501277396091105280 2022-03-08 11:23:18 -0800 <ggIzento> @phsidefender Another reason to hate Apple. Also bet the monitor is proprietary or some shit.
1501277298397376513 2022-03-08 11:22:54 -0800 <oliviadetoma_> apparently i’m allergic to apples now i’m gonna fucking spit
1501277247692443650 2022-03-08 11:22:42 -0800 <Cosmic_Julie> i keep forgetting i have apple music + spotify 🤡
1501277209461346304 2022-03-08 11:22:33 -0800 <RetroTechNoir> @VADR_01 @timber_custom @platospupil Comparing apples &amp; oranges. European countries put high taxes on gasoline but in return they receive services for their money: public transportation, health care,  etc.  California pays sky high taxes and gets nothing in return except potholes
1501277148715253760 2022-03-08 11:22:19 -0800 <dennisjaffee> @JALaymance Love it but not sure I’m springing for Apple TV just for that
1501277133821210624 2022-03-08 11:22:15 -0800 <DiscoverMalcom> @markgurman Mark, it is so painful. I got Sierra Blue and it’s sexy in on right but this one looks like seduction, why Apple why?
1501276979697389577 2022-03-08 11:21:38 -0800 <yiningkarlli> The Apple Silicon Mac I’ve been waiting to be able to buy this whole time was a 27 inch iMac equivalent, and it looks like the M1 Ultra-equipped Mac Studio fits the bill!
1501276868472815620 2022-03-08 11:21:12 -0800 <hernameiskayIa> @shegoldenhs I hate Apple Music lmao 😭
1501276850298908672 2022-03-08 11:21:08 -0800 <blackwidow0491> Oh your @Spotify is down? Oh boo boo Can’t relate I have @AppleMusic 😌
1501276833270022145 2022-03-08 11:21:04 -0800 <hrryscorpio> may have to use apple music for the rest of today bc spotify still hasn’t let me back in
1501276744904437761 2022-03-08 11:20:43 -0800 <Dee_sedano> Apple Music would never
1501276723920334851 2022-03-08 11:20:38 -0800 <xhechicera> “Spotify &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Apple Music” 🤡🤡🤡  lmao apple music was always king
1501276599898951684 2022-03-08 11:20:08 -0800 <Carti_G> Lol all the bottoms complaining that Spotify is down! Apple Music is where it’s at !!
1501276552314507264 2022-03-08 11:19:57 -0800 <Hawkmir1> @LBSamuelsson @CamiLee13 If they are using an iPhone, it’s probably the best option. Especially with Apple fitness available for multiple types of workouts
1501276519833890823 2022-03-08 11:19:49 -0800 <sc8709> @DNVRSN Apple owes you a check atp
1501276486778507270 2022-03-08 11:19:41 -0800 <SleezeMaraj> @SSshadali Than AMAZON? Girl where else would it be? Its Apple or Amazon lol tidal?
1501276450422509570 2022-03-08 11:19:32 -0800 <MagicJohnson> My father is battling dementia, so the project really hit home for me.   Mark my words, Sam will win awards for his performance and the series will be awarded as well! The last days of Ptolemy Grey airs March 11th on Apple TV+.
1501276445993095171 2022-03-08 11:19:31 -0800 <shawnelivernois> @Graceeeful like ew you expect me to use Apple Music now???? Gross
1501276367941357568 2022-03-08 11:19:13 -0800 <SheLuvsJess3> Spotify went down and I immediately switched to Apple Music you got me fucked up
1501275982627549189 2022-03-08 11:17:41 -0800 <KipStedwell> Yo ytf @apple keep telling us how much better the A15 is than IPHONE8? Y do we care about a 5yr old phone?
1501275954575917058 2022-03-08 11:17:34 -0800 <Hawkmir1> @LBSamuelsson @CamiLee13 I use an Apple Watch. You tell it the length of the pool and it keeps track of the stroke you are using and how many lengths you have done. There is also an open water workout for ocean swimming  The only issue I have had is sometimes it adds a lap when I backstroke
1501275828126060547 2022-03-08 11:17:04 -0800 <Alex_Misty> MLB announces their owners and teams made billions cause Apple is now televising games and the NFL just blew up the league and made fans CRAZY for next year…just stay away MLB no one cares
1501275810409299972 2022-03-08 11:17:00 -0800 <DNVRSN> wait — Apple discontinued the 27-inch iMac?  dirty.
1501275782601056257 2022-03-08 11:16:53 -0800 <m2olson> @MacRumors there is a new set of Apple Watch band colors live on the store
1501275674543276040 2022-03-08 11:16:27 -0800 <DDamient> @tim_cook Hola! We need an Apple Store in #Guadalajara JALISCO 🇲🇽 MEXICO!!
1501275653307469828 2022-03-08 11:16:22 -0800 <Jay_Jets59> @morac__ Apple Music&gt;
1501275568414740482 2022-03-08 11:16:02 -0800 <noxidleinahtan> @Apple The pre-recorded events are much more polished, but they lack any of the charm and humanity of the live ones. I hope you go back to the stage shows!
1501275556582596608 2022-03-08 11:15:59 -0800 <Fraulein89> @_ParkTheBus Apple Music is the best. Sorry, not sorry.
1501275496868237322 2022-03-08 11:15:45 -0800 <JSmooth> It’s still Spotify &gt; Apple Music.
1501275382758076422 2022-03-08 11:15:18 -0800 <xaaronmychaelx> so what was spotify users saying about apple music again?? 😂
1501275198594506759 2022-03-08 11:14:34 -0800 <JillianAdel> my emo playlists on apple music are fine phew
1501275108312182785 2022-03-08 11:14:12 -0800 <MadBliss> @MANTRABLU There are sites that do this for you, I switched from Apple Music to spotify a few yrs ago and all my music transferred over
1501274989370101770 2022-03-08 11:13:44 -0800 <TheLordFalconis> @CatherineLugg That's like, EVERY Apple event though.
1501274972706144256 2022-03-08 11:13:40 -0800 <waynesworld> Amazing how much power @Apple wields with US wireless carriers.  #iPhoneSE3 doesn’t have mmWave radio which would be a non-starter for any other brand trying to get on 5G networks like Verizon
1501274960001585153 2022-03-08 11:13:37 -0800 <svntino> @tonypagota apple music would never

1501274207929487362 2022-03-08 11:10:38 -0800 <eierund> @ChristianSelig I always saw the iMac Pro as a compromise anywyas when Apple was about to kill off the Mac Pro
1501274053893672964 2022-03-08 11:10:01 -0800 <FrankieC88> @jon_prosser Gas prices in CA $10 and Apple is selling $4,000 computer. Way to read the room Apple.

1501273465558421508 2022-03-08 11:07:41 -0800 <hrryscorpio> apple music doesn’t hit like spotify
1501273345194528769 2022-03-08 11:07:12 -0800 <moses_sux> Time to finally cash in that free trial of Apple Music. Hopefully Spotify is back by this time next month
1501273326001426434 2022-03-08 11:07:07 -0800 <jacobolenick> I'll be waiting for @MKBHD's review on Apple Studio and Studio Display this week.
1501273307810725890 2022-03-08 11:07:03 -0800 <everythingluis> So one question? It looks like apple already teased us about the new green iPhone because if you go on your wallpapers we have a green live wallpaper.. 🧐🧐🧐 #AppleEvent
1501273295307505665 2022-03-08 11:07:00 -0800 <FortheEdwin> @death2jane @Spotify @AppleMusic You cant log in either???

1501273287111835648 2022-03-08 11:06:58 -0800 <Haimynameismike> Why does @Apple make all their               ~ p r o ~  models come in silver or black. My queer ass tryin to make this 💰💰on a purple Macbook pro. Shit
1501273244816470021 2022-03-08 11:06:48 -0800 <kaylashmaylaa> @Spotify logged me out and won’t let me back in and i am. ready. to. scream. don’t make me get apple music please…
1501273220258754564 2022-03-08 11:06:42 -0800 <LaurenCButler> This is why I pay for both Spotify and Apple Music.
1501273169289637888 2022-03-08 11:06:30 -0800 <IvyMcNally> I hope the Apple event is just an announcement that they are going to turn off all our computers and phones forever.
1501273150029385728 2022-03-08 11:06:25 -0800 <nbyromeo> @lxsbiandean i’d rather listen to music on youtube than use. apple music

1501272580589699079 2022-03-08 11:04:10 -0800 <btrflywingspn> Apple Music is better sadly
1501272566744313858 2022-03-08 11:04:06 -0800 <ardenbee> @Apple really used #AppleEvent day to say “switch to Apple Music. You have no choice.” #comebackspotify
1501272483818733570 2022-03-08 11:03:47 -0800 <ScottJenstad> @MattWi77iams @drhoa3 The timing isn't great, ha, on your side there. Apple should have announced the new CBA in the same press release.

1501272244680474626 2022-03-08 11:02:50 -0800 <DaPoetsTerrence> I got a text from an iphone user saying that the Apple event was trash.
1501272200283770885 2022-03-08 11:02:39 -0800 <vetrujillo> So happy I’m an Apple Music user 😊

1501272061129330693 2022-03-08 11:02:06 -0800 <aylinafuckation> How convenient that I got Apple Music free for a month when Spotify didn’t let in 🥺

1501272015809875975 2022-03-08 11:01:55 -0800 <LawlersLawYo> @Pho_MeLongTime @yg_monroe I used to have full bars on my Galaxy everywhere I went. I have a ton of dead spots now with my Apple iPhone 13 Pro. The AI is crap &amp; it takes more steps to do something that took me one on Android.  Probably the biggest tech purchase mistake I’ve ever made in my life. 😭

1501270858433585158 2022-03-08 10:57:19 -0800 <jeffersongraham> Two Mac Studios: $1,999 and $3,999. Add new Studio Display monitor: $1,599. Buy two of the top of the line Macs, and you're at $5,600. (Cheaper than a tank of gas, right?) And a new Mac Pro is coming, Apple says. #appleevent

1501270118084399104 2022-03-08 10:54:23 -0800 <00sidiot> @Apple i cant girlboss in these conditions
1501270071292751875 2022-03-08 10:54:11 -0800 <Henwy24> Apple Music would never 🥱🥱🥱
1501270056671449089 2022-03-08 10:54:08 -0800 <ian_dica> @_omgitsveronica @LifeContradicts @Spotify they need to quit playing before I switch to apple again 😭 I just paid the $10 too
1501270041097998340 2022-03-08 10:54:04 -0800 <ronnymarroquin> @Iatinwave It’s still Spotify &gt; Apple Music 😌
1501269989109628931 2022-03-08 10:53:52 -0800 <goforbrookie> Ways to know your brain is not about you today: You keep trying to use your Apple Pencil on your phone   🙃🙃🙃🥲
1501269974534406144 2022-03-08 10:53:48 -0800 <authorityhop> @kdhairbrush @TheMMQBL @MagicJohnson @RichStapless @russwest44 that was 2012; and the words are focused on the player not his family; I swear people in our society today Do NOT know how to make comparisons.  Y'all think everything is the same; What happened to the education of Americans - Oranges are not Apples ...
1501269959715868676 2022-03-08 10:53:45 -0800 <ashleyy_sernaa> Spotify got 2 hrs to get it together before I decide to switch to apple

1501269929772793858 2022-03-08 10:53:38 -0800 <mostlikelyedgar> I guess I’ll use Apple Music…
1501269909472374785 2022-03-08 10:53:33 -0800 <RodKim> Apple Keynote starts and moments later, Spotify and Discord go offline…I’m not one for conspiracy theories, but that’s hilarious.
1501269902782459904 2022-03-08 10:53:31 -0800 <naciasi> send me your apple music login &amp; I'll love you forever 💘
1501269870670868485 2022-03-08 10:53:24 -0800 <eyenovation> Well thanks @Apple - my credit card is hiding from me thanks to the #m1ultra and this new display.
1501269845999976450 2022-03-08 10:53:18 -0800 <alizzaavv> apple music &gt;&gt;

1501269669667229696 2022-03-08 10:52:36 -0800 <hipmosis> Apple Music would never treat me this way :( #Spotify
1501269661664497665 2022-03-08 10:52:34 -0800 <ReyCranston> I got Apple Music I’m chillen enjoy your Spotify tho 😊
1501269555724783621 2022-03-08 10:52:08 -0800 <loljoyeux> @Spotify Apple Music listeners are probably laughing at us rn
1501269546795028480 2022-03-08 10:52:06 -0800 <TrolleyBlue> @dra4 Can understand how some people are peeved they have to see to sign up for another subscription service to see MLB games. Will apple have option of a single game purchase on the apple store?
1501269504600395777 2022-03-08 10:51:56 -0800 <metallican1601> M1 Ultra?? @Apple gonna start making Gaming PCs soon.
1501269474678226949 2022-03-08 10:51:49 -0800 <jayy7431> What all this about Spotify lol good thing i have Apple Music
1501269473793249286 2022-03-08 10:51:49 -0800 <Kelloggs94> With Spotify being down guess I gotta use musty ass Apple Music
1501269457447964677 2022-03-08 10:51:45 -0800 <clinthanaway> All this apple chip stuff aside- WOOO THUNDERBOLT DISPLAY IS BACK!  Or studio display or whatever
1501269447591432192 2022-03-08 10:51:43 -0800 <csd7942> @AriZonanHODL #Bitcoin drops 4% in 2022. This has made it one of the best performing assets, after energy, financials, gold, Google and Apple. $BTC is reflexive. A new narrative can be seen coming out.
1501269438363947010 2022-03-08 10:51:41 -0800 <meowmitake> Apple Music User
1501269438015971341 2022-03-08 10:51:40 -0800 <flaviotsf> This Apple Studio Display is 🔥 for WFH #AppleEvent
1501269436027715584 2022-03-08 10:51:40 -0800 <NicoleRosalena> Spotify is down and I can’t listen to my own thoughts so it’s either Apple Music or NPR One I guess…
1501269424678051843 2022-03-08 10:51:37 -0800 <AndreElijah> Damn it Apple - how much is today going to cost me?
1501269348555509762 2022-03-08 10:51:19 -0800 <tonx> Every time I get excited about what I could do with the latest state of the art Apple hardware I just have to remind myself I haven’t gotten around to updating my personal webpage in many years.
1501269329937010688 2022-03-08 10:51:15 -0800 <valentinaaro> Being forced to use @Apple Music today since @Spotify is down. Not at all hating the throwbacks.
1501269250782089218 2022-03-08 10:50:56 -0800 <rileytestut> ok yes this Studio Display is exactly what I wanted, plz take my money Apple
1501269244406681601 2022-03-08 10:50:54 -0800 <AllTradeNoGas> @SpotifyUSA @Spotify if my account isn't fixed within the hour. I'm moving to @AppleMusic 🤷‍♂️
1501269226081841158 2022-03-08 10:50:50 -0800 <ErikMcMahon9> The display has an A13??!!!! Damn Man #AppleEvent #Apple
1501269211548581891 2022-03-08 10:50:46 -0800 <ChristianGlawe> Countdown to folks running to online Apple Store, pegging all the configs full bore, then complaining about how expensive the new #Apple machines are... #AppleEvent
1501269181651513347 2022-03-08 10:50:39 -0800 <justinheacock> @Spotify logged me out of my family account as the primary and all of my other family members and it can’t seem to locate my username or email. Does this mean it’s time to switch to @AppleMusic??
1501269168837910529 2022-03-08 10:50:36 -0800 <ReporterVince> a good day to be an apple music user
1501269144087384064 2022-03-08 10:50:30 -0800 <NorthwestNick> @spicyfusilli Apple Music &gt;&gt;&gt;  Forever and always lol
1501269108192514054 2022-03-08 10:50:22 -0800 <lgoretti_> spotify is down and i was about to break down but then remembered i still have apple music 🎶 my work day was about to drag on especially with the voices in my head being so loud 😆
1501269106082807810 2022-03-08 10:50:21 -0800 <aye_yo_CC> Guess the Apple Music users are having a good laugh at us rn 🙃
1501269104673517573 2022-03-08 10:50:21 -0800 <itsthatjacob> @Spotify is down. Gonna switch to @AppleMusic just for that. Not very premium of you @Spotify
1501269098298150917 2022-03-08 10:50:19 -0800 <DNVRSN> apple displays are always so good. so so good.
1501269052408221699 2022-03-08 10:50:08 -0800 <CreativeTVMinds> Soo @Apple made the mac mini a Mac Pro 😮. I was thinking about getting completely separate mobile and studio rigs, so this is tempting for my next Mac. Especially since I max out CPU often on big sessions (thanks Soothe 2).   #M1Ultra #ULTRACOMBO #MacStudio #AppleEvent
1501269013506117641 2022-03-08 10:49:59 -0800 <naciasi> this reminds me of that man who had his gf screen record songs off of apple music for him...at the time it was definitely giving broke n*gga behavior, but now I'm thinking he may have been ahead of the curve 😭
1501268910099689475 2022-03-08 10:49:35 -0800 <ScottJenstad> @drhoa3 @MattWi77iams Me too, and it’s two games a week. Not like they threw 3 games a night behind the apple paywall.
1501268892160696325 2022-03-08 10:49:30 -0800 <KimmJaneth> All I’m saying is Apple Music has never crashed on me &amp; I just switched to Spotify a month ago lol 🤷🏻‍♀️ #spotify
1501268855544369153 2022-03-08 10:49:22 -0800 <ruizluisx> it’s a good day to have apple music because spotify is down 🥰 I’d fr kms if I had no music all day
1501268851404668934 2022-03-08 10:49:21 -0800 <esaadat> @lamw Can we run ESXi  on Apple MAX Studio Ultra? LOL
1501268830898638850 2022-03-08 10:49:16 -0800 <_Afromann> Spotify tripping, I’m lucky I still have Apple Music 🤪
1501268818944880643 2022-03-08 10:49:13 -0800 <500fakers> Spotify down ??? Yeaaaa Apple Music here I come now….
1501268811944656903 2022-03-08 10:49:11 -0800 <Ch3nley> @king_glouis_XI apple music master race
1501268811030274051 2022-03-08 10:49:11 -0800 <octaves_> i-it’s like apple doesn’t hate creatives anymore 🥲
1501268776532144128 2022-03-08 10:49:03 -0800 <christianeckels> I forgot about the Apple event and I survived.
1501268752142266368 2022-03-08 10:48:57 -0800 <jocelynmmendezz> i just know apple music users are laughing at us right now
1501268654377164803 2022-03-08 10:48:34 -0800 <jeffersongraham> Apple is really dragging out this infomercial to the all-important pricing punchline. #appleevent
1501268606859956229 2022-03-08 10:48:22 -0800 <ErikMcMahon9> Apple really be taking this environment stuff seriously man…RESPECT.#Apple #AppleEvent  #MacBook
1501268522705379329 2022-03-08 10:48:02 -0800 <benjamin____s> @marliechoo Nah Apple Music still trash 🗑
1501268510327992328 2022-03-08 10:47:59 -0800 <kaisters> So that mean I gotta use dumb ass Apple Music?
1501268502514216965 2022-03-08 10:47:57 -0800 <cuddlybaer11> Damn didn’t realize how weird my Apple Music library is
1501268490409316355 2022-03-08 10:47:54 -0800 <_AaronLederer> If I were Apple I would bring back the 99 cents for 3 months promo
1501268474957467651 2022-03-08 10:47:51 -0800 <SHAWTYSLIM> Apple just said; we just built the best computer ever, and it’s vegan.
1501268398419808256 2022-03-08 10:47:33 -0800 <GerardUht> Ok. So someone is going rogue or Apple greenlit an absolute burn-the-house-down roast of its own products.  Woof.   But also #MacStudio lookssocoooooooool!!!
1501268375791550468 2022-03-08 10:47:27 -0800 <KenTrinhCodes> @JilianneParker @Apple lol umm hmm 👍😜
1501268319495602180 2022-03-08 10:47:14 -0800 <MoCertiified> NOT ALL apple users use apple music 🧐❗️ WTF wrong with spotify today.
1501268273882619908 2022-03-08 10:47:03 -0800 <_maaaarii_> @whatevergisel Apple Music don’t be doing that 😌
1501268222468837379 2022-03-08 10:46:51 -0800 <JilianneParker> @KenTrinhCodes @Apple Damn you! 😅
1501268147164237826 2022-03-08 10:46:33 -0800 <nicolenidelian> Mac studio looks like a big Apple TV for ur desk
1501268145197125635 2022-03-08 10:46:32 -0800 <adkimery> @j_salvo Anyone that bought a Mac Pro after Apple announced the move away from Intel knew this day was coming sooner rather than later.
1501268108819898372 2022-03-08 10:46:24 -0800 <Damnlena__> Times like this is when I’m glad I pay for Apple Music too 😅
1501268095939186689 2022-03-08 10:46:20 -0800 <iceeplsfocus> Spotify down i guessssss I’ll use Apple Music 🙄
1501268075475181568 2022-03-08 10:46:16 -0800 <SickTweetsBro> This apple event just made me take a $50k personal loan 😩😩
1501268055434809347 2022-03-08 10:46:11 -0800 <JayBanzia> So many graphs @apple. We get it, it’s fast. #MacStudio
1501268030713516036 2022-03-08 10:46:05 -0800 <kraml21> @BillGates yo bill apple is fucking you in the ass right now
1501268013101699072 2022-03-08 10:46:01 -0800 <ShikhJohari> Apple Just eliminated the entire high end computing industry. Yes I am not kidding lol #AppleEvent
1501267952791801856 2022-03-08 10:45:46 -0800 <timunderwood> Whoever stage manages these Apple events has successfully stripped out everything that made Steve's keynotes so engaging. There's no authenticity at all.  Each presenter cycles through the same four approved hand movements, delivered from an awkward power stance.
1501267922529832962 2022-03-08 10:45:39 -0800 <J0hannaV_> Spotify is down so now I'm forced to listen to that U2 album on Apple Music 😭
1501267885804584966 2022-03-08 10:45:30 -0800 <ariesmilf26> i knew i should’ve stuck w apple music
1501267861339181061 2022-03-08 10:45:25 -0800 <drewcoffman> @dhof apple spending this entire segment telling people how terrible Mac Pros are is definitely a bold choice
1501267833929437185 2022-03-08 10:45:18 -0800 <BDavisCollins> Great day to mention the plethora of Jim O’Rourke albums that were just added to Apple Music…
1501267820767637504 2022-03-08 10:45:15 -0800 <onetechmind> Really sounds like Apple is positioning this as a perma-replacement for 27-in iMac. #AppleEvent
1501267814014873602 2022-03-08 10:45:13 -0800 <miserydotbiz> if you find yourself confusing fiona hill and fiona apple congratulations that is a lifestyle™

1501267781961977858 2022-03-08 10:45:06 -0800 <lennyluvs> @youngmoney5013 *me complaining in apple music*
1501267766438875136 2022-03-08 10:45:02 -0800 <_HAZYDOJA> atleast i have apple music
1501267752350195717 2022-03-08 10:44:59 -0800 <crybabyhunterr> if Spotify does fix itself now i’m gonna get apple music
1501267731819085824 2022-03-08 10:44:54 -0800 <KenTrinhCodes> @BalkrishnaP @JilianneParker @Apple 👍💯👀
1501267705600479232 2022-03-08 10:44:47 -0800 <LouUrena310> @erickelpaisano @celinesnts quiet Apple Music headass
1501267623773835264 2022-03-08 10:44:28 -0800 <reuben81691> Good thing I signed up for that six month free trial of Apple Music back in December. C’mon @Spotify get it together. Y’all really doing this to us right now. 🙃🤦🏽‍♂️
1501267599753052163 2022-03-08 10:44:22 -0800 <DragonLoliCrim> I’ve been logged off of my Spotify and now I’m freaking out cause I have shit to do and I have ADHD AND I NEED MUSIC TO FUNCTION IN SOCIETY. PLEASE HELP.  I have 6 months of Apple Music for free but NOW I GOTTA REBUILD MY PLAYLISTS.  KILL ME. 😭😭😭
1501267537102655502 2022-03-08 10:44:07 -0800 <iiiCorrupted> Apple Music &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
1501267536419061764 2022-03-08 10:44:07 -0800 <marx_shark> Apple Music &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Spotify 💀
1501267422145175554 2022-03-08 10:43:40 -0800 <jeffersongraham> If I bought the old Mac Pro computer, I'd feel like a chump. New Mac Studio is 50% faster, Apple says. Mac Pro had been sold as pricey, fastest Apple computer #appleevent
1501267416852021251 2022-03-08 10:43:39 -0800 <activezayd> Is Apple Music the move??
1501267393347158019 2022-03-08 10:43:33 -0800 <Neptunesalad> Seriously the woman explaining #MacStudio is explaining why every other product that @apple makes is garbage compared to it.
1501267375466815494 2022-03-08 10:43:29 -0800 <spicer> I like the way Apple shows off their new products by telling you how shitty the last Apple product you bought only a few months ago really is.
1501267368986615808 2022-03-08 10:43:27 -0800 <AustenRose> Should we all just switch to @AppleMusic really quick?
1501267362418286596 2022-03-08 10:43:26 -0800 <Lukester00> @FOS Apple going after the Boomers
1501267314527727617 2022-03-08 10:43:14 -0800 <SHAWTYSLIM> Apple flexing like a mf…  I wanna see this price
1501267307166765059 2022-03-08 10:43:12 -0800 <A1Javii> Really using Apple Music for the day 😑
1501267269103407105 2022-03-08 10:43:03 -0800 <trinedykru> Can we have a featured outfits in the @apple store from apple events. I need that satin copper blazer in my life.
1501267265743777794 2022-03-08 10:43:03 -0800 <00sidiot> @Apple the way i RAN to twitter to check if spotify was down 😭
1501267246219345922 2022-03-08 10:42:58 -0800 <todbot> SD card slot on the front?! USB-A on the back?!  omg Apple
1501267192884588544 2022-03-08 10:42:45 -0800 <slickluvsrap> Should I make an Apple Music tweet or should I read the room?
1501267141831499781 2022-03-08 10:42:33 -0800 <Chrislp427> @charlieINTEL If Apple music goes down, ya'll already know who jinxed it
1501267125641564160 2022-03-08 10:42:29 -0800 <jassy__boo> So ig Apple Music it is…
1501267054137016322 2022-03-08 10:42:12 -0800 <MatthewYonemura> Spotify was hacked by an Apple Music user who was jealous when we posted our Spotify wrapped
1501267045505142785 2022-03-08 10:42:10 -0800 <cmelanyyy> maneeee spotify really… time to go to apple music  jk spotify is better for me 🥲🧎‍♀️
1501267044821450753 2022-03-08 10:42:10 -0800 <bbhkf78> @mikemayer22 So basically MLB is going to get a ton of money from Apple, yet the owners are afraid to spend money on the players. Got it
1501267035963023361 2022-03-08 10:42:08 -0800 <migo_buzo> Told yall Apple Music better 🤷🏻‍♂️

1501266931847860224 2022-03-08 10:41:43 -0800 <C_Dubs4> @glmrckVanny I’d rather sit in silence than use Apple Music
1501266926940553218 2022-03-08 10:41:42 -0800 <Saldizzal> This is Apple music's first W in 6 years
1501266918413590531 2022-03-08 10:41:40 -0800 <PresidentialMP> Apple Music &gt;&gt;
1501266904882679811 2022-03-08 10:41:36 -0800 <kaylsebrown> Spotify is down but I still have Apple Music 😈
1501266846674214914 2022-03-08 10:41:23 -0800 <BillShaikin> If Dodgers or Angels are selected for the new Friday Night Baseball, you'll need Apple+ to watch. No broadcast on SportsNet LA or Bally Sports.  From Apple: "Friday Night Baseball will be available on Apple TV+ -- and, for a limited time, without the need for a subscription."
1501266799676968960 2022-03-08 10:41:11 -0800 <slickluvsrap> @444dira Come to Apple Music
1501266754458116099 2022-03-08 10:41:01 -0800 <GeoffGyllenhaal> discord and spotify being down has led me to use twitter dms and apple music. makes me wonder when the gcloud status page will update
1501266740658905088 2022-03-08 10:40:57 -0800 <Swagg> Apple Music &gt;
1501266729070063618 2022-03-08 10:40:55 -0800 <WestCoastPat> There are now six different channels and/or streaming services required to watch MLB. Shocking that they're having trouble growing the game among people under 30.  Fox TBS ESPN Sportsnet LA MLB .TV Apple TV+
1501266641409114115 2022-03-08 10:40:34 -0800 <mattagnello> "Pro audio jack." That is the most Apple way to describe a headphone jack EVER.
1501266622966743042 2022-03-08 10:40:29 -0800 <shxkarii> @jyrxse apple music WOULD NEVER
1501266580499435523 2022-03-08 10:40:19 -0800 <CFC_isaiah2> @kylerussforever Apple is better

1501266342514606083 2022-03-08 10:39:22 -0800 <stovak> “We’ve built the new Mac Studio to capitalize on YouTube zoomers willingness to blow $5000 on new hardware every six months.” - Apple
1501266267935703040 2022-03-08 10:39:05 -0800 <Zibaddiejad93> lmao apple just dropping unnecessary things tbh #AppleEvent

1501266238621708289 2022-03-08 10:38:58 -0800 <aylinign> Spotify kicking me out of my account when I don't even use it😌 Apple could never
1501266235933093888 2022-03-08 10:38:57 -0800 <17RingzWRLD> @briantong looks like the Apple TV with usb ports and sd card reader in the front😂😂
1501266226047193092 2022-03-08 10:38:55 -0800 <AubieAnderson> @Hauntterr Bro doing ANYTHING to not use apple music 🤦‍♂️
1501266178613735429 2022-03-08 10:38:43 -0800 <onetechmind> @imtinet "This is something only Apple can do." 😝
1501266139678064640 2022-03-08 10:38:34 -0800 <EQUIPTsmif> Trying to use the native apple podcast app bc @Spotify is down and this shit suuuuuuuucks.
1501266126575050755 2022-03-08 10:38:31 -0800 <ILYSIB> @JaviRhlm 🕺🏻 YouTube for now or Apple

1501266004839911424 2022-03-08 10:38:02 -0800 <notbrodyjenner> OH SHITTTTT! New Apple Display is so fucking sexy
1501265982932676608 2022-03-08 10:37:57 -0800 <moonmancastro> @Spotify why ur shit just continue to be trash @AppleMusic baby i’m sorry i’m ready to come home
1501265962124808192 2022-03-08 10:37:52 -0800 <SloanWorkshop> First reaction, #MacStudio is the ugliest thing @Apple has made in a long time.
1501265827147902981 2022-03-08 10:37:20 -0800 <cris_markovich> I want (what I'm calling) this M1 Ultra score on Apple Music #AppleEvent
1501265798534336512 2022-03-08 10:37:13 -0800 <Taylor_M_Allen> No single word gets professional Apple fans’ hearts aflutter more than “MODULAR.”
1501265692129038337 2022-03-08 10:36:47 -0800 <Arix_Ki> @jamiegraydesign That feels like a stretch  But maybe the “always on” tech the newest Apple Watches have? 👀
1501265670108893186 2022-03-08 10:36:42 -0800 <specker> Apple MK Ultra, reality distortion field. #AppleEvent
1501265639436013568 2022-03-08 10:36:35 -0800 <OLCVTA> @BullpenVideos @Ourand_SBJ I’d think blocked, otherwise it’s not an incentive to get Apple TV. Could be wrong.
1501265586336133129 2022-03-08 10:36:22 -0800 <4kyle7> @my_pronouns I got Apple Music too suck my dick

1501265504408784899 2022-03-08 10:36:03 -0800 <trinedykru> @engadget Kudos @apple for showing all women software devs in your Ultra video. #representationMatters
1501265435014025221 2022-03-08 10:35:46 -0800 <MaskedGorilla> apple music user interface is mid
1501265419767791620 2022-03-08 10:35:42 -0800 <its_menieb> @MKBHD Apple is the king of processing
1501265384132911113 2022-03-08 10:35:34 -0800 <CFC_isaiah2> @LAxFLAME Apple Music better
1501265365963137024 2022-03-08 10:35:30 -0800 <lanewood> Apple went all in on highlighting women developers for their new M1 Ultra silicon, without calling them “women developers,” just developers. #AppleEvent
1501265364474232832 2022-03-08 10:35:29 -0800 <justuni_> apple music &gt;&gt;&gt;
1501265358237286404 2022-03-08 10:35:28 -0800 <noriko_val> @SnazzyQ Faster than a 3060ti and 12900k with 1/3 the power consumption? Finally seeing something good coming out of apple 🙏
1501265246794620928 2022-03-08 10:35:01 -0800 <ChelseaMarie4L> Whelp. Paying for both Apple Music and Spotify is really paying off for me right now.
1501265235369283584 2022-03-08 10:34:58 -0800 <Arix_Ki> Apple interviewing all women in their developer reaction video is a nice touch for an event on international women’s day :)
1501265234991861763 2022-03-08 10:34:58 -0800 <CFC_isaiah2> Apple &gt; Spotify
1501265228109021186 2022-03-08 10:34:57 -0800 <SloanWorkshop> @siracusa It really feels like naming team at Apple needs some fresh blood. LOL
1501265150107553797 2022-03-08 10:34:38 -0800 <JacksonATucker> @_nevaada1 The ghost of Steve Jobs is powering the Apple satellite ray which is DDOSing Spotify servers currently since Russia bought them out, stay posted for more…
1501265104876163073 2022-03-08 10:34:27 -0800 <oABerry> Ok @Apple #ilovetoseeit  only interviewing women engineers on the new iMac power…  #AppleEvent  #WomensHistoryMonth
1501265071283990537 2022-03-08 10:34:19 -0800 <highermath> Will the new Apple M1 Ultra become the ultimate mining engine? Asking for a friend.
1501265050698272770 2022-03-08 10:34:14 -0800 <ILYSIB> @Vanlenciacf I did but it doesn’t really feel like they curate them as well as Spotify does. Apple Music is like the fancy clean version of Spotify without the cute little perks.
1501264871752486913 2022-03-08 10:33:32 -0800 <yslarchie> Spotify is so trash I’m switching back to Apple Music
1501264796594835456 2022-03-08 10:33:14 -0800 <richp823> Just made an Apple Music account since Spotify is down 🤷🏽‍♂️
1501264793574854660 2022-03-08 10:33:13 -0800 <Exodia3618> @MKBHD apple sucks with dis design they milkin it🍼🥛🥛🥛🥛
1501264779024814083 2022-03-08 10:33:10 -0800 <saintdeliuh> spotifys down, good day to have apple music 🙏🏻
1501264755536891910 2022-03-08 10:33:04 -0800 <thisweekinmls> Never been happier to be an Apple Music user than right now 🙃
1501264746690928641 2022-03-08 10:33:02 -0800 <ShaakirJoyce> Notice how Apple Music doesn’t go down 😎
1501264734389092353 2022-03-08 10:32:59 -0800 <eric_young_1> @IvanTheK Have you tried  Apple Music?
1501264682421678081 2022-03-08 10:32:47 -0800 <dianetbh> I don't know when I became a person who watches the Apple live events but here we are...
1501264602616971264 2022-03-08 10:32:28 -0800 <luquin_ricardo> Spotify crashed while Apple Music is booked and unbothered rn 😌
1501264596404817921 2022-03-08 10:32:26 -0800 <paulhorne> Let’s have the guy with the most hard to understand accent at Apple explain our most complicated chip ever 👍 #AppleEvent
1501264558144385033 2022-03-08 10:32:17 -0800 <richontech> Apple just introduced a new chip called M1 Ultra that is up to 8x faster than their M1 chip and uses less power than other processors #AppleEvent
1501264548325572610 2022-03-08 10:32:15 -0800 <mentalitasolare> Apple Music for today ig
1501264544638795776 2022-03-08 10:32:14 -0800 <MercsFx> @J_Dub23_1 right, I wonder if Apple was told to or not lol
1501264534161350660 2022-03-08 10:32:11 -0800 <jeffersongraham> M1 Ultra fastest chip ever for a personal computer, Apple says: and it will only cost you.....? #appleevent
1501264528381644804 2022-03-08 10:32:10 -0800 <JacksonATucker> Spotify kicked me out mid Jimmy Buffett, but I’ll still be damned if you catch me on Apple Music
1501264517082189827 2022-03-08 10:32:07 -0800 <BradleyFronek> Apple Music&gt;
1501264411536891914 2022-03-08 10:31:42 -0800 <VictorJLim> Apple innovation is always so amazing
1501264375088181254 2022-03-08 10:31:33 -0800 <jeffersongraham> We get the idea Apple. the new M1 Ultra chip is very fast. And you're going to want us to pay big bucks for it too. Get to the punchline. #AppleEvent
1501264373033046023 2022-03-08 10:31:33 -0800 <yuusharo> I never want to hear Apple fans make fun of another company’s naming schemes ever again…
1501264366972198912 2022-03-08 10:31:31 -0800 <ParseNoire> apple criticism aside im really excited to see what m1 ultra does to the rest of the industry  hyped for scaled up arm/risc architecture
1501264297116065796 2022-03-08 10:31:15 -0800 <sampalokkkk> grrrrrr why did apple rearrange my app library categories ): instagram, tiktok, and twitter should all be under social
1501264290438909961 2022-03-08 10:31:13 -0800 <BreonMitchell3> Apple Ipad go up $2k😭💀😭💀😭Apple worth $2trillion dont buy product price go down
1501264223887716357 2022-03-08 10:30:57 -0800 <BennyBanksKID> ohhhh this new apple keynote is really trying to get me to go broke.
1501264204728262660 2022-03-08 10:30:53 -0800 <askhalid> Would be hilarious if they required the filmmakers of Apple TV+ Originals to edit on iMovie.
1501264187938332673 2022-03-08 10:30:49 -0800 <steveintech> Yea Apple snapped
1501264165872095232 2022-03-08 10:30:43 -0800 <VictorJLim> Apple really just slapped two chips together
1501264107038670849 2022-03-08 10:30:29 -0800 <ILYSIB> The only complaint I have about Apple Music is my inability to find a good playlist I feel like Spotify was really good about making playlists based on a song  🧍🏻‍♀️
1501264101216899072 2022-03-08 10:30:28 -0800 <PapiPhat> apple music enthusiasts win again
1501264083089121281 2022-03-08 10:30:24 -0800 <mikeaveli24> @EreBornAgain @Spotify I’m glad I got Apple Music too 😭😂
1501264035790028800 2022-03-08 10:30:12 -0800 <Razzball> Apple TV and MLB are perfect partners. Apple TV is the home of Severance, a show about a man who compartmentalizes his life to forget about his wife's dying. MLB is the home of a league that is dying.
1501264035790016512 2022-03-08 10:30:12 -0800 <adityasood> How fast does twitter dot com run on this new Apple chip?
1501263989518442501 2022-03-08 10:30:01 -0800 <carlosdeverdad_> Apple flexing at this point with the new chip 😂
1501263932874321922 2022-03-08 10:29:48 -0800 <onetechmind> Apple Silicon makes Moore's Law relevant again. #AppleEvent
1501263917611245573 2022-03-08 10:29:44 -0800 <annavvb> Did the Russians hack Spotify? Asking in I have Apple Music 🤐
1501263901601808391 2022-03-08 10:29:40 -0800 <BreonMitchell3> @benwood Stop buying apple products rich get richer
1501263890075635714 2022-03-08 10:29:38 -0800 <typefiend> Apple M1 Ultra  ))&lt;&gt;(( Forever
1501263859226578950 2022-03-08 10:29:30 -0800 <jkashdan> Apple loyalist here. Thus far, I think these events are losing their luster. Beautifully produced but incremental product adds just don’t feel as newsworthy. Anyone else feel this way? #AppleEvent
1501263845699907591 2022-03-08 10:29:27 -0800 <Chr1stopherLara> spotify acting up 😭😭 so i finally activated my free 7 day trail of Apple Music

1501263727605075968 2022-03-08 10:28:59 -0800 <ytLume> @Nick_Grover YouTube music on top. And Apple Music there about the same.
1501263688518410243 2022-03-08 10:28:50 -0800 <metrofanboy> Apple Music subscriptions rn 📈📈📈
1501263681883049985 2022-03-08 10:28:48 -0800 <VIIsampson> Apple is hella overrated man they do these annual events and the products don’t even change or improve lol
1501263677634199557 2022-03-08 10:28:47 -0800 <froilanfuentes> Apple is just flexing at this point with this brand new M1 Ultra chip. #AppleEvent
1501263661158920193 2022-03-08 10:28:43 -0800 <IsolateAndChill> apple is essentially what amd has been doing with threadripper and combining chiplets to scale up core count #AppleEvent

1501263370518892544 2022-03-08 10:27:34 -0800 <kevinrnash> @ahabrian89 @JayMaysHays @schwifty00 @cammorey0331 @mikebloodworth @JeffPassan Apple TV+ is available on any device with access to the internet, including PCs running Windows.
1501263360087629827 2022-03-08 10:27:31 -0800 <Taylor_M_Allen> Gotta wonder if they marketing team at Apple thought of MK Ultra when they named the new, best chip M1 Ultra.  Also: 🤤
1501263225660182529 2022-03-08 10:26:59 -0800 <soundslikeLewis> Apple be like “what chip shortage"
1501263192118333443 2022-03-08 10:26:51 -0800 <believablybad> Apple just keeps adding cooler words to the end of M1 and calling it a new thing.
1501263180806254603 2022-03-08 10:26:49 -0800 <jeffersongraham> M1 Ultra is Apple's fastest processing chip, announced at the #appleevent.
1501263096194551809 2022-03-08 10:26:28 -0800 <radunkle> M1 ULTRA?!?! #Apple

1501262811304849409 2022-03-08 10:25:20 -0800 <savoyellis> Apple be hyping everything lol
1501262775535816711 2022-03-08 10:25:12 -0800 <yulimoney> back to apple music i guess

1501262648721084420 2022-03-08 10:24:42 -0800 <hrryscorpio> i refuse to use my apple music account
1501262638155665409 2022-03-08 10:24:39 -0800 <brandononearth> @CubicleApril @Apple It’s a broader problem with most mainstream “family” experiences. Spotify family is billed through one credit card, all streaming services billed through one card (not to mention treating watching as if everyone watches alone). Key decision makers only picture a nuclear family.
1501262597097541633 2022-03-08 10:24:29 -0800 <kingthor> if i was king of apple i would have simply sent out an email to sum up the first 20 minutes of this event
1501262590470602756 2022-03-08 10:24:28 -0800 <chrisw> No one comes close to Apple's marketing team. Unreal production.
1501262547739037696 2022-03-08 10:24:18 -0800 <richyrich> @kurogod5 Use Apple Music you bot
1501262533730062336 2022-03-08 10:24:14 -0800 <everytimeicash> $AAPL iPhone SE: Apple announced iPhone SE, a powerful new iPhone in an iconic design, with exceptional capabilities and performance at an incredible price. iPhone SE comes in a compact and durable design, and together with iOS 15, delivers a seamless user experience
1501262497629630467 2022-03-08 10:24:06 -0800 <DemiYork> *me on my way to apple music since spotify crashed* “hey siri play Cut My Life Into Pieces by Papa Roach”
1501262493254963202 2022-03-08 10:24:05 -0800 <specker> @harrymccracken Seems like 3rd party video apps have been eating Apple’s lunch. #AppleEvent
1501262464108929033 2022-03-08 10:23:58 -0800 <everytimeicash> $AAPL Apple announces the new iPhone SE; details iPhone 13 lineup

1501262394051350528 2022-03-08 10:23:41 -0800 <jcvaughan_> The most impressive thing about these Apple events isn’t the products it’s the show itself.  Apple is a video making powerhouse. #AppleEvent
1501262273158914050 2022-03-08 10:23:12 -0800 <delafuckincrowe> spotify might be down, but good thing i also have apple music and amazon music 😂
1501262255446376449 2022-03-08 10:23:08 -0800 <EthanAndLiamHD> So far the Apple event isn’t very exciting #AppleEvent but still more to go so…
1501262193286803465 2022-03-08 10:22:53 -0800 <exit1200> The irony if they start talking about Apple Music while Spotify is down.
1501262184189292545 2022-03-08 10:22:51 -0800 <alrightymarilyn> time to switch to apple music
1501262121585291265 2022-03-08 10:22:36 -0800 <BBTeamNorth> Hearing some Yebba in this Apple even was exactly the energy I need this afternoon.
1501262094678646784 2022-03-08 10:22:30 -0800 <justinkichlerr> Spotify down? Apple Music would never 🥱
1501261937555869696 2022-03-08 10:21:52 -0800 <YourStarPower1> @cookieeeedough Awwww look. You got an Apple too.
1501261778742759425 2022-03-08 10:21:14 -0800 <Lhyrahaha> I got logged out of my Spotify, does that mean I have to use Apple Music now 🥴
1501261725139570691 2022-03-08 10:21:02 -0800 <onetechmind> M1 on Apple Watch when? #AppleEvent
1501261639944847362 2022-03-08 10:20:41 -0800 <adrianacuee> I got the month trial for Apple Music bc @Spotify really kicked me out of my premium acc????? See what it comes down too bc u can’t act right
1501261610156847104 2022-03-08 10:20:34 -0800 <Lopez310x> @erikbagtalk Apple Music &gt;
1501261597083381765 2022-03-08 10:20:31 -0800 <JilianneParker> @GO_GO_ELECTRIC @Apple Yes, the SE with the A15 chip for $429. Brilliant!
1501261546344701953 2022-03-08 10:20:19 -0800 <antxnio52> spotify’s down???? after all this time i spent defending y’all against apple music ?!??? knowing damn well i liked apple music more, but i had to stay loyal to spotify??? oh this is sick. #Spotify u will be dealt with .
1501261529609486338 2022-03-08 10:20:15 -0800 <SOHMI_> @NicoleMoudaber @AppleMusic @HoneyLuvmusic @ela_minus Thank you QUEEN for the support, and thank you to your fans who messaged in with their requests! Happy #InternationalWomenDay2022 🥲💖
1501261508671676420 2022-03-08 10:20:10 -0800 <LouieZamp26> @redsoxandstuff Why? Cuz you already have apple tv?
1501261498793877505 2022-03-08 10:20:08 -0800 <KenTrinhCodes> @WholeMarsBlog Agreed. Apple just not the same without Steve.
1501261483597987840 2022-03-08 10:20:04 -0800 <ismailkidd> So all the tech YouTubers gonna sell all these shitty Apple products to everyone for the first month or so. Then a month later release another video how everyone wasted their money on the slightly updated Apple products. #AppleEvent
1501261483019149314 2022-03-08 10:20:04 -0800 <Jabreeezy26> Spotify getting hacked and shut down. Laughs in Apple Music
1501261431286730754 2022-03-08 10:19:51 -0800 <j0shdee> @ToxicCosWynaut it’s the Apple event that’s crashing discord lol
1501261429323624453 2022-03-08 10:19:51 -0800 <CryptoDustLA> @YousyXO They prolly think I’m Russian. Only thing I’m rushin is back to Apple Music lol
1501261230098432002 2022-03-08 10:19:03 -0800 <radunkle> Apple just added the M1 to iPad Air 🤯
1501261154244386818 2022-03-08 10:18:45 -0800 <WhatTheCJ> Most noticeable observation is the lack of wildly cool intro around Apple Park, and a lack of real enthusiasm and pizzazz?   #AppleEvent
1501261144463273984 2022-03-08 10:18:43 -0800 <derekstavis> I wanted to share how I appreciate Apple's new keynote format featuring the people behind building Apple.
1501261069238489088 2022-03-08 10:18:25 -0800 <VictorJLim> Pretty standard and normal Apple Event so far. No “peek” performance yet
1501260969997074449 2022-03-08 10:18:01 -0800 <ruiz_marioo> @EddieDreamin_ Apple Music would never
1501260652815343620 2022-03-08 10:16:46 -0800 <OskieMignon> Apple's iPhone SE is gunning for the Pixel A series. But why the dated look? 🤷 #TeamPixel
1501260637095141376 2022-03-08 10:16:42 -0800 <Aranza_Alexan> @Spotify stop logging me out of my account or I’m switching to Apple Music 😒
1501260632859062278 2022-03-08 10:16:41 -0800 <everytimeicash> $AAPL Apple and Major League Baseball (MLB) today announced "Friday Night Baseball," a weekly doubleheader with live pre- and postgame shows that will be available to fans in eight countries exclusively on Apple TV+ as soon as the regular season begins.

1501260449303592962 2022-03-08 10:15:57 -0800 <HeyMarkL> So what’s that racing game? I can’t find it in Apple Arcade 🤔
1501260438998114306 2022-03-08 10:15:55 -0800 <HoneyLuvmusic> @NicoleMoudaber @AppleMusic @SOHMI_ @ela_minus Thank you soo much 💜
1501260361290461193 2022-03-08 10:15:36 -0800 <JilianneParker> @dictionaryhill @Apple Lordy!
1501260352658362380 2022-03-08 10:15:34 -0800 <jeffersongraham> Apple raised the price os the iPhone SE to $429 from $399. For the stronger chip, I guess $30 is worth it! #AppleEvent
1501260313554919433 2022-03-08 10:15:25 -0800 <brookelonegan> oh hi Apple TV+ opening the #AppleEvent 🤩
1501260105257414657 2022-03-08 10:14:35 -0800 <joehribar> @Titus_Andro87 I do! I play Apple Arcade games every day. Some on my phone too.
1501260100303941632 2022-03-08 10:14:34 -0800 <Razzball> MLB owners turn their pockets inside out to show they have no money and an Apple TV deal accidentally falls out
1501260066279677956 2022-03-08 10:14:26 -0800 <ParseNoire> discord doesn't want me to shitpost during the apple direct lol
1501260042187595782 2022-03-08 10:14:20 -0800 <JNVAxo> Apple said we need all these mfs to have our phone with this upgraded iphone 8.
1501259919810433030 2022-03-08 10:13:51 -0800 <doctorow> Apple apparently absolutely *must* maintain its own app store to maintain its high standards of safety and ethics, but for some mysterious reason it absolutely *can't* run its own factories, which would let it end forced labor and other sweatshop conditions. 31/
1501259908611809285 2022-03-08 10:13:48 -0800 <doctorow> If Apple pushes Apple Music over rival music apps, how can you tell which music app is "best?" This is a policy that can only be successfully managed from deep inside Plato's Cave, where the objective truth of all things is revealed without ambiguity. 19/
1501259904249696264 2022-03-08 10:13:47 -0800 <doctorow> That means that Microsoft can control the lion's share of the sale of games - and also compete with the games studios whose wares it sells. Apple can do the same for apps, and Google and Facebook can do it for ads (FB also wants to do it for VR). 14/
1501259853729202180 2022-03-08 10:13:35 -0800 <El_Jefy> @Apple apenas inicia su presentación y ya me decepcionaron con el #iPhoneSE3
1501259835664384013 2022-03-08 10:13:31 -0800 <doctorow> Today, vertical mergers and vertical monopolies are the backbone of platform capitalism. Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and others have created "two-sided marketplaces" that connect buyers and sellers, in which they *also participate as buyers and sellers*. 13/
1501259827724627968 2022-03-08 10:13:29 -0800 <doctorow> That's where the debate over tech has arrived at: the idea that we must preserve giants like Facebook and Google and Apple and Amazon to continue to derive the benefits they deliver, and that only the great geniuses at their helms are qualified to lead them. 5/
1501259810095779840 2022-03-08 10:13:25 -0800 <0r0d717> @BossBeautiesNFT LFG!!!  Boss Beauties &gt; Apple Event  😂😂😂 ❤️❤️❤️

1501258666204270593 2022-03-08 10:08:52 -0800 <KenTrinhCodes> @JilianneParker @Apple On time = Apple Watch ...? No? Another bad Ken joke for the books. 👀
1501258388134498307 2022-03-08 10:07:46 -0800 <_KaMz> Friday night baseball on Apple TV and there isn’t even a season rn. LUL #AppleEvent
1501258375132155905 2022-03-08 10:07:43 -0800 <JilianneParker> @Solarbrother2 @Apple Yes.
1501258357029568512 2022-03-08 10:07:39 -0800 <HoweJacq> @MikeSington Apple shouldn't have accepted it in the first place
1501258217237594119 2022-03-08 10:07:05 -0800 <richontech> Apple will start streaming Friday night baseball on #AppleTVPlus. Two games each Friday night. #AppleEvent
1501258215270469639 2022-03-08 10:07:05 -0800 <exit1200> Love Apple getting into baseball broadcasts. (If we have baseball.)
1501258191782436864 2022-03-08 10:06:59 -0800 <JilianneParker> @KenTrinhCodes @Apple We’re about to find out.
1501258181992857601 2022-03-08 10:06:57 -0800 <Taylor_M_Allen> Apple promoting getting MLB on AppleTV+…hopefully there’s an asterisks for *if season doesn’t get cancelled because the owners don’t want to use Apple’s money to pay the players.
1501258069832921089 2022-03-08 10:06:30 -0800 <CallMeWEBB> Nobody cares about Baseball @Apple
1501258054880292868 2022-03-08 10:06:26 -0800 <curieluis> friday night baseball on apple tv+
1501258053374513154 2022-03-08 10:06:26 -0800 <spicer> Announcing Friday Night Baseball, assuming there is baseball this season and those billionaire owners can decide to let their be a season, coming to Apple TV+!
1501258051382177792 2022-03-08 10:06:26 -0800 <joereedy> Apple TV+ announces Friday Night Baseball
1501258019341934594 2022-03-08 10:06:18 -0800 <tldtoday> I swear. Apple’s cinematography is one thing but their cuts, feel, pacing is as good as it gets.
