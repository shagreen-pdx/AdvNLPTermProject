1496223817664196610 2022-02-22 12:42:11 -0800 <tooTattaTrot> The internet going out is just confirmation I need to log out on time. My poor iPhone hotspot can’t sustain all the chit I need to do today
1496223812236554240 2022-02-22 12:42:09 -0800 <jmmccarthy2002> @HRCLauren FYI since iPhone Xs, dual SIM (two lines) is supported
1496222487683731459 2022-02-22 12:36:54 -0800 <ntownsend25> @MrWillPowerr Why isn’t iPhone always on “low battery mode” it charges faster and trains slower…feels like that should be the option and you can choose to drain your battery if you want
1496222198272512004 2022-02-22 12:35:45 -0800 <balOShere> i really wish iphone would remind me of texts i haven't replied to after a day or two.   more notifications + more time on silent = lots of forgotten texts... seems like really low hanging fruit for improving relationships.
1496214033506222081 2022-02-22 12:03:18 -0800 <HighLife89> One thing I’ve noticed since switching to an iPhone is that the autocorrect is way worse than on an Android. Google has better predictive text and understands what you’re trying to say better.
1496213619297632260 2022-02-22 12:01:39 -0800 <taj_too> The amount of Crazy I just dodged was fucking 🤌🏾💋. This Ho who I met on fucking Twitter got mad at me because I didn’t want to spend $100 on some iTunes card so she could update her iPhone 5s! Da fuq of all Fuqs😜 Miss me with the Fuck Shit bae.
1496209925923614721 2022-02-22 11:46:59 -0800 <NIOChicago> @LipingGuan $NIO Yes if you look at companies with really strong eco systems what they all have in common is that they have an operating system. We see the same OS in different hardware, like Apple has the same OS in iphone, iPad, watch, laptop.  NIO can go from EV to phone with same OS.
1496209656691232773 2022-02-22 11:45:55 -0800 <Dfabian21> Oculus may very well be $FB iPhone wouldn’t surprise me if the market was getting this one very wrong
1496205147357302787 2022-02-22 11:27:59 -0800 <SaucyDubs_> @vvinta_ iPhone 13 is better
1496196557837852676 2022-02-22 10:53:52 -0800 <NIOChicago> $NIO People are saying they would never buy a phone from NIO because it’s Chinese. 😂 I can come by and pick up your PS5, iPhone, big screen TVs, and appliances since they are all made in China with Chinese parts by Chinese people. #NIOSmartphone
1496194313809797125 2022-02-22 10:44:57 -0800 <thefancycryptid> alt recs are welcome, but plz don't tell me iphone lol  im an accident prone,. uncoordinated disaster and i regularly bounce this unfortunate device off of sidewalks, floors, and the interiors of public transit 😬  me + fragile af iphones? never gonna happen
1496182876345352192 2022-02-22 09:59:30 -0800 <KnowItAllDoll> Anyways why my daddy call me asking how to turn the music off on his new iPhone 13. Y’all my daddy is a Director of Cybersecurity and can’t work a phone I’m 😭😭😭😭😭😭
1496182319773884420 2022-02-22 09:57:17 -0800 <teasplat> the new focus settings on iphone rly help though because now i’m not obligated to respond right away when i just don’t want to. it’ll tell people i don’t want to be disturbed and that’s enough for me
1496180722113163278 2022-02-22 09:50:56 -0800 <cg_clarizio> @SissiphusHypno @truckyeahh @bikramjitbiswas @sleepesocialist Such a blatant tankie lie, the only thing government contributed to iPhone was Siri .
1496180242049867778 2022-02-22 09:49:02 -0800 <cg_clarizio> @razisidd @truckyeahh @bikramjitbiswas @sleepesocialist No they didn’t , the only thing the government contributed was Siri , a mostly useless feature you use less than 20 times in your whole iPhone life.
1496172555593560071 2022-02-22 09:18:29 -0800 <Bulldozers77> @BestFtso This is great but I still can’t buy the when I use my iPhone 12 and Bifrost  it’s not clickable. Spoke with Bifrost and they said it’s in your end

1496154906134155267 2022-02-22 08:08:21 -0800 <VanceBullivant> @iPhone_News It's an excellent browser. It really is. I'm using it as my main browser, next Chrome, sometimes Safari (rarely) - and lastly would be Firefox.
1496132853591126024 2022-02-22 06:40:43 -0800 <4est_libertate> @dougboneparth One of the worst iPhone features is screen rotation auto-correction when you turn the phone upside down.   I can no longer correct my investment portfolio.
1496114281112383489 2022-02-22 05:26:55 -0800 <DtheRecreator> @AppleSupport bought my iPhone 12 on Dec 2020.  Now battery health is at a 85%??? I know the battery degraded over time but this seems extreme
1496108501201997827 2022-02-22 05:03:57 -0800 <prawncutlet> anyone have an old iPhone they want to give away mine cracked and it’s how I do all my business —- let me know xoxo
1496106031805513740 2022-02-22 04:54:08 -0800 <ak_vickil> Let's be realistic... Girl there's no difference between your throwback and present , I saw u today and I was like maybe that's her throwback ...the diff is you lend an iPhone to throw shades ...🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣..#akvickil #throwback #girl @Emirealll @ak_vickil @davidobrother
1496104794158678018 2022-02-22 04:49:13 -0800 <Reckless_Attack> @jennastrautman @Chase0the0Ghost I think we still have our old iPhone recordings sitting around somewhere? Definitely have our prequel adventures starring Hotey in the RA Valuts

1496004992142041088 2022-02-21 22:12:39 -0800 <chicagosvryown> lowkey this android is better than my iPhone 👀
1495999163347124225 2022-02-21 21:49:29 -0800 <patches_swayze> who the fuck taught jordan peterson how to use garageband and imovie on his iphone 6?
1495992250677047301 2022-02-21 21:22:01 -0800 <____kaybeeeeeee> I think Candace would’ve been successful if she had an iPhone.
1495989381030629377 2022-02-21 21:10:37 -0800 <BrendonTroutman> @dgold Thanks! That’s helpful. Was using iPhone X with a projector. I think it was just being temperamental.  Can’t quite bring myself to pay for premium for some reason.
1495985341370613763 2022-02-21 20:54:34 -0800 <KingJames773> I refuse to put a case on my iPhone 😭
1495984924112957442 2022-02-21 20:52:54 -0800 <KingJames773> The craziest thing is Apple repairs iPhone 13 Pro/Max rear glass now. So in order to get a $99+ tax replacement, I have to crack my rear camera lens, bend the enclosure or somehow liquid damage the phone 😅.
1495982478435176457 2022-02-21 20:43:11 -0800 <KingJames773> I dented my iPhone 13 Pro Max in two corners the other day. I’m mad lol.
1495982071520628741 2022-02-21 20:41:34 -0800 <hailey_anne13> having an iphone 8 in 2022 is by far the most humbling experience i’ve ever had
1495969798831886336 2022-02-21 19:52:48 -0800 <Dr312_Lo> Silence unknown callers has proven to be one of the best iPhone features.
1495961705532243968 2022-02-21 19:20:38 -0800 <cursed_queer> I waver between the “my iPhone is broke can you fix it” family member and the “can you design my resume” family member
1495958478485135361 2022-02-21 19:07:49 -0800 <krystiangebis> Maybe the world used to be just as insane, and we just didnt know because the iPhone didn’t exist yet

1495940566865035266 2022-02-21 17:56:39 -0800 <thatskay22> I’m movin to Houston with just my IPhone if that’s what it is lmao
1495939686887575560 2022-02-21 17:53:09 -0800 <imaaronross> @codyblue_ @jennaezarik As a full apple user (iPhone, Mac Mini, and iPad Pro), I still have the XR and feel like I have the full apple experience minus a few of the photo/video upgrades.   But as someone who carries my mirrorless camera with me everywhere, that is not a big deal to me.
1495935432760119296 2022-02-21 17:36:14 -0800 <dylcodes> Responsiveness will forever be the death of me. I get my website working all nice for the iPhone standard widths. I then view my site on Chrome and its perfect. When I view it on Safari, its like some of the elements I put into place just don't exist. Can't win lol.

1495826424221118465 2022-02-21 10:23:05 -0800 <Rocckky> @DISHONERD303 @UniverseIce After a year of comparing iPhone Max Pro with S21U  can't say it's the case. Especially when just pointing and shooting. Quick photo shots. Videos S21 competes in daylight. Hoping S22 closes the gap
1495818928169398276 2022-02-21 09:53:18 -0800 <LifeofaPlayboy> 40 said @Drake recorded “Champagne Poetry” on an IPhone and I just spent a couple racks on studio equipment 😒
1495814591468773376 2022-02-21 09:36:04 -0800 <jandrew67> @BBYNews Horrific experience with your N. Riverside, IL Geek Squad. Dropped off iPhone 8 @ 1:40 Sunday afternoon for new battery. NO word back and it’s almost noon, the next day. I’ve called and left the store 2 VMs via transfer by your call center, and they have EM the store 2x

1495789706705047554 2022-02-21 07:57:11 -0800 <AliLovesshoes> @Apple Hahahahahahahaha they are very liars, the #iphone falls and breaks, the battery lasts the day but without using the cell phone (everyone walks with the charger in their pocket) and it has only been waterproof for 2 years, and the #Samsung and #Huawei a decade ago.Not recommended

1495772662961999875 2022-02-21 06:49:27 -0800 <RamblinGrimace> I don't have an iPhone, so no #TruthSocial for me. Yet.

1495538545544601601 2022-02-20 15:19:09 -0800 <BigMuneyLilMike> Is the iPhone 13 worth getting?

1494365547626172418 2022-02-17 09:38:05 -0800 <RevMacLive> Can you tell my why I can’t mute the audio in @TwitterSpaces. I need to be able to not hear the speakers at times. I can’t even lower the volume to a point that isn’t loud on my iPhone. Very frustrating to say the least.   I’m forced to leave a space because I can’t mute audio.
1494356416412454913 2022-02-17 09:01:48 -0800 <Matthewosowsk17> We don’t wanna break up with me We are doing all data and junk… iPhone what is your day another 1030
1494351715113607172 2022-02-17 08:43:07 -0800 <GreekAthlete7> @jonbraylock @AnnaRoisman Yep, same old iPhone. 🤣🥲

1494344935373430784 2022-02-17 08:16:10 -0800 <chartier> Sometimes I wish the iPad and iPhone had a screen recording buffer like video game consoles.  That they constantly captured the last ~ 30 seconds of what happened on screen and we could save it at any moment.  Then I remember this would be a privacy nightmare, so never mind.
1494343457997049866 2022-02-17 08:10:18 -0800 <Pika_Punch> What about the iPhone 13 mini or the Galaxy S21 FE?
1494332499756871695 2022-02-17 07:26:45 -0800 <JCoxDotBrew> It’s real if they use the grid on their iphone camera
1494332044226150403 2022-02-17 07:24:57 -0800 <_CRod> @ferstival …no, nunca. Un iPhone 4 pudo ser? El zoom y lo sucio en la pantalla del tuyo provoca lo borroso de la fotografía.

1494177429124005890 2022-02-16 21:10:34 -0800 <manandmaschine> @Apple Christ how did you make the screen and buttons even smaller on the iPhone 13? Sad. I liked my 11 much better. You make this s**t any smaller and I will have to hire a baby to type for me. Ridiculous.
1494156733920514053 2022-02-16 19:48:20 -0800 <arayofsunnshine> @aintu_steve You got them on find my IPhone ?

1494149829877981191 2022-02-16 19:20:54 -0800 <TheMichaelPee> @iupdate The iPad Pro is the best thing apple came out with! It has the professional side of the MacBook Pro and it has the fun side (the App Store) of the iPhone. It’s a perfect business/pleasure mix.
1494131224838909957 2022-02-16 18:06:58 -0800 <annielivinglab> tech friends: my messages on my Mac book Air NEVER reflect/match what is on my iPhone. I’ve followed all the steps online, both devices are updated, PLZ HELP! It drives me nuts @AppleSupport

1494088097838948353 2022-02-16 15:15:35 -0800 <Victorshi2020> 11/x: I make my rounds again with my Find My iPhone app in hand, and suddenly, my phone begins vibrating -- apparently an indication that it's "very nearby."   A jolt of optimism fills me. But I needed it to be real.   I enter the IT room right next to me.
1494088087575486465 2022-02-16 15:15:33 -0800 <Victorshi2020> 2/x: I arrive at Anderson, walked into the classroom, and found nothing. Strange, huh? Yeah, that's what I thought.   I spent the next 45 minutes walking around Anderson with my Find My iPhone on.  Went into every classroom. Asked people near the displayed location.   Nothing.
1494088086266941441 2022-02-16 15:15:33 -0800 <Victorshi2020> 1/x: Last Th, I woke up without my AirPod Pros.   Immediately, I opened the Find my iPhone app, and it indicated it was at UCLA's Anderson School of Management--where I was the night before.   Me: Easy. Go to the classroom I was in &amp; retrieve them.   But no.  It gets complicated.
1494087170671484932 2022-02-16 15:11:54 -0800 <1klosikk> @estheticfairy Ale masz iPhone i możesz otworzyć wiadomość nie wchodząc w nią 😏😎❤️

1494067069360484354 2022-02-16 13:52:02 -0800 <ReaseSkoP> @Britlin__ Its prolly a burner most likely. But scamming on a iphone is crazy😭😭

1494049038693384193 2022-02-16 12:40:23 -0800 <jacksonWILL> Crack on the back of my iPhone. Is it the phone or is it the tempered glass? Afraid to find out.
1494045066792476674 2022-02-16 12:24:36 -0800 <trevoramueller> @OgawaBurukku Nice. I haven't made the jump to iphone (my work phone is apple, however), but I know so many people who like theirs. I may need to make the jump.   Plus, my current phone camera is dead (it currently splits the screen), so I haven't been taking a lot of pictures lately...
1494038292760829952 2022-02-16 11:57:41 -0800 <branewyrms> @LouBegaVEVO the old iphone alerts for me to this day

1494012264294359042 2022-02-16 10:14:15 -0800 <Wandering_Jones> @0xandreharrison Jesus, I need a new iPhone so bad. Which model is that? (Dope photos brotha!)
1494004682456551428 2022-02-16 09:44:08 -0800 <JermiloGamingHD> I’m watching #Arthur25 marathon via my iPhone during break  #Arthur #ArthurPBS
1493995979409874946 2022-02-16 09:09:33 -0800 <sarakendrewtype> Does Juergen Teller have dimly lit blackmail photos on his iPhone 8? Why does he keep getting jobs?!
1493992194956533768 2022-02-16 08:54:30 -0800 <RossRead> The Dallas Cowboys paid what they pay for bottled water in the locker room to settle Peeping Tom charges. Dude had his iPhone out recording women. Disgusting.

1493968533033783299 2022-02-16 07:20:29 -0800 <ByWorking> Maybe if I tweet @ATTHelp I will actually get an answer. I bought an new iPhone, and I can't get product support. What a dreary roundabout you've trapped me in. A 1-800 call sends me to a a chatbot, which chats, then sends me right back to the same 1-800 number.
1493953877565227011 2022-02-16 06:22:15 -0800 <StacheEsq> I meant to text my mom that we are going to Northbrook, and my phone changed it to “birth room.” So thanks for that uncomfortable conversation, iPhone.
1493950196325232642 2022-02-16 06:07:37 -0800 <cr0issantitties> @bafontenerdel well I dont use that I wouldnt know. I do know you can do much more w an android over an iPhone
1493823712868683776 2022-02-15 21:45:01 -0800 <bulentm> We’re about to have an iPhone CPU that has over 30 billion transistors. When I was a kid, entire desktop CPUs had like 10 million transistors.
1493818469091061760 2022-02-15 21:24:11 -0800 <BadgerNoonan> @vbarot87 Apologies for the spelling, my iPhone knows I tweet more about Lord of the Rings.

1493776584859217920 2022-02-15 18:37:45 -0800 <Banerjeezy> @MKBHD The goal is to prevent iMessage from intercepting text messages when I return to Android. For this reason, I assume email? Any general tips on how best to prevent this? I first encountered this problem when switching away from iPhone 3gs, can't believe it's still a problem
1493775433422229505 2022-02-15 18:33:10 -0800 <Banerjeezy> @MKBHD I have a question I don't think many people can answer well. If I plan to switch back and forth between Android and iPhone, is it better set iMessage to initiate conversations from my email or my phone number? What are the advantages and disadvantages to either?
1493765766855991298 2022-02-15 17:54:46 -0800 <Matthewosowsk17> Remind me to go Alibaba yeah I don’t know about that i.e. higher mobile nine Hawaii permanent waves by being anti-he would eat Hawaii whatever time I ask where we did we met on here iPhone I already pets head

(And yes, I once charged mine near @camdros iphone and suddenly they were "Camille's Airpods". I was like now hang on!) It's weird they can't track them though - they're supposed to be able to do that.
1493741466098745348 2022-02-15 16:18:12 -0800 <DFAREAL2> I can't do this anymore 😔 I'm going back to iPhone 🙄

1493728491690291206 2022-02-15 15:26:39 -0800 <ChiBuildings> Also, buying a new iPhone was my best purchase of 2021
1493718622560215047 2022-02-15 14:47:26 -0800 <ByWorking> Jeez, @ATT, I buy an new iPhone, and what a dreary roundabout you've  trapped me in while trying to deal with tech questions--sending me right back to where I started.
1493718214299299844 2022-02-15 14:45:48 -0800 <AShot_ofKEYLA> My job gave us new iPhone. When I say Apple so mfin weak it's ridiculous.

1493633256419377157 2022-02-15 09:08:13 -0800 <BenjaminCrew1> The scam is that you will be given a check to purchase an iPhone and iPad. That check will obviously not clear immediately and you'll be told "go ahead and buy the iPhone and iPad and send it to us so we can install your software."

1493311622298931203 2022-02-14 11:50:09 -0800 <GayRobot_> @kiotsukeruzo @danieledagnelli @nocashirl @SwiftOnSecurity Not like there’s several competing management frameworks out there for the mac. Not like Apple invented the concept of an MDM framework. Not like I can’t push certificates to thousands of machines in seconds via the same push notification service that runs iPhone.
1493305931375026178 2022-02-14 11:27:32 -0800 <K_bellanegra> iPhone is blowing me today. Can’t send iMessages

1493288686640943106 2022-02-14 10:19:01 -0800 <EricAdler2> @crystallgnaires @muchnerve So, what you're saying, Crystal, is that Capitalism didn't make the iPhone, Capitalism made the iPhone suck?  Am I reading you right?
1493285555647430657 2022-02-14 10:06:35 -0800 <heyitsmlg> I have so many pictures of food that my iPhone made a video of all the food pics I have and named it “good eats” 😂
1493284467728953351 2022-02-14 10:02:15 -0800 <Fit_Marguerite> @Steadfaaaast Nope! The camera in the iPhone 13 pro is incredible
1493283753610858502 2022-02-14 09:59:25 -0800 <swanksalot> Hi @Twitterrific - how can I best report a bug (I think) with Twitterrific/ iOS 15.4 / iPhone X?
1493280039319871491 2022-02-14 09:44:39 -0800 <bvigeant> kind of like first gen iphone games, I imagine we're in the midst already of a cull of early-gen VR games. Not enough support to justify carrying those games over and current hardware doesn't like the old games, so they might be lost!
1493274742052331520 2022-02-14 09:23:36 -0800 <aqueerwolf> @kogrrr Mac can do it! Why can’t iPhone ughhhhh
1493266862733291521 2022-02-14 08:52:18 -0800 <aim4thahardt> @lisaharst @ScandalABC Also, horizontal split-screen shots.  They should've added an iPhone camera sound between scenes.
1493266189358874626 2022-02-14 08:49:37 -0800 <Knocking_Ghost> @Trevornoah @roywoodjr After changing the color scheme to black it feels and works exactly the same for me on an iPhone.
1493257625118691328 2022-02-14 08:15:35 -0800 <grizzleebear14> my twitter account was suspended for posting a brief, shaky iphone-recorded snippet of the slope style celebration as it was playing on my tv. can twitter...chill?
1493256946874523653 2022-02-14 08:12:54 -0800 <chitownben> @nypost Does his lawyer think she was rolling around 21 years ago with an IPhone taking pictures. I hope the “Prince” goes away for a long time
