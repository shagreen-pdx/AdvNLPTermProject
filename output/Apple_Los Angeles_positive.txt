Then what differentiates iPad Air 5 and iPad Pro besides dual camera system if both got m1 chips and 120hz displays Apple wants Promotion to be part of Pro lineup Like newer MacBook pro iPad Pro and iPhone Pro series Regular iPhones didn t get 120hz so don t expect for Air 5
I don t think you know what poverty is if you re calling a 400 luxury item a poverty phone What an ignorant comment Many can t or don t feel it s necessary to spend over 1k on a cell phone that literally just needs to call and text

Apple has lots of clever engineers Sure it wouldn t work in the current iMac design but a new design centered around M1 Ultra is absolutely feasible iMac Pro is definitely coming says my money
The free Apple Music subscription just started charging me on the same day that this Spotify crash is going on clearly my membership is very valuable and these companies will stop at nothing to have me

Supporting AR in mobile browsers would be a huge obvious and immediate win for both developers and consumers and it s been within Apple s reach for a long time IMO as long as they continue this sabotage it s too generous to say they re shipping WebXR

Forgot that I had a free trial for Apple Music and I m finally giving it a try since Spotify wants to be slacking It won t be the same considering I have like a decade worth of music saved on Spotify

Imagine a Beowulf cluster of Apple Studio Displays lol

Yeah I can t imagine it s really actually modular beyond the way you configure displays We are back to the classic apple black box situation which is a fair trade off esp now with their custom chips imo It looks good tho
I can admit that Spotify is pretty elite but I get Apple Music fa free and Spotify tryna take my money lol
Crazy idea for a project but hear me out what if you got the Apple keyboard with Touch ID and turned it into a wireless Touch ID button Cut the board etc while somehow keeping the Bluetooth connectivity intact all in a new case Would be the best Mac desktop accessory
Apple Music always comes in handy in the long run tho
spotify is beans lmao apple music on top
Apple event was meh Expectations were too high when I heard they re revealing new hardware Was hoping for some iGlasses tbh
I think the veneer Apple puts on all of their keynotes has finally worn off for me It used to be fun to watch when they offered truly interesting products but now it feels more like it is being used to hide shortcomings
Spotify is down so I luckily have a week of free Apple Music or whatever hehehe
Wow Apple with a bomb shell AppleProRaw AppleEvent
I m Apple But my desktop version at my desk is alive and well
The tech gap between intel and apple is huge now
Spotify is down time to jump onto my Apple Music lmao

Spotify better get there shit together because I am not using ghetto ass Apple Music
You may be underestimating the value of it being an all in one That s a big deal for some customers A bigger iMac also can mean beefier cooling allowing a rumored quad Apple Silicon chip to fit at with a better display mini LED 120hz etc

Spotify ain workin Good thing my dumbass pays for Apple Music too
Remains to be seen but my guess is Apple will make those games free like YT did this year for the games on its service
Good day to be an Apple Music user
Does not appear that Apple is keeping the old iPhone SE around at a lower price A missed opportunity in my opinion Carriers and resellers I m sure will have a field day though with it
Comparing apples amp oranges European countries put high taxes on gasoline but in return they receive services for their money public transportation health care etc California pays sky high taxes and gets nothing in return except potholes
Love it but not sure I m springing for Apple TV just for that
Mark it is so painful I got Sierra Blue and it s sexy in on right but this one looks like seduction why Apple why

The pre recorded events are much more polished but they lack any of the charm and humanity of the live ones I hope you go back to the stage shows
Apple Music is the best Sorry not sorry

So many graphs We get it it s fast MacStudio
Apple Just eliminated the entire high end computing industry Yes I am not kidding lol AppleEvent
Whoever stage manages these Apple events has successfully stripped out everything that made Steve s keynotes so engaging There s no authenticity at all Each presenter cycles through the same four approved hand movements delivered from an awkward power stance
Great day to mention the plethora of Jim O Rourke albums that were just added to Apple Music
Really sounds like Apple is positioning this as a perma replacement for 27 in iMac AppleEvent
Apple Silicon Fast

First reaction MacStudio is the ugliest thing has made in a long time
No single word gets professional Apple fans hearts aflutter more than MODULAR

Apple went all in on highlighting women developers for their new M1 Ultra silicon without calling them women developers just developers AppleEvent
Faster than a 3060ti and 12900k with 1 3 the power consumption Finally seeing something good coming out of apple
Whelp Paying for both Apple Music and Spotify is really paying off for me right now
Apple interviewing all women in their developer reaction video is a nice touch for an event on international women s day
It really feels like naming team at Apple needs some fresh blood LOL
The ghost of Steve Jobs is powering the Apple satellite ray which is DDOSing Spotify servers currently since Russia bought them out stay posted for more
Ok ilovetoseeit only interviewing women engineers on the new iMac power AppleEvent WomensHistoryMonth
Will the new Apple M1 Ultra become the ultimate mining engine Asking for a friend

Never been happier to be an Apple Music user than right now
I don t know when I became a person who watches the Apple live events but here we are
Let s have the guy with the most hard to understand accent at Apple explain our most complicated chip ever AppleEvent
Apple innovation is always so amazing
We get the idea Apple the new M1 Ultra chip is very fast And you re going to want us to pay big bucks for it too Get to the punchline AppleEvent
I never want to hear Apple fans make fun of another company s naming schemes ever again
apple criticism aside im really excited to see what m1 ultra does to the rest of the industry hyped for scaled up arm risc architecture
grrrrrr why did apple rearrange my app library categories instagram tiktok and twitter should all be under social
Apple Ipad go up 2k Apple worth 2trillion dont buy product price go down

Would be hilarious if they required the filmmakers of Apple TV Originals to edit on iMovie
Apple really just slapped two chips together
The only complaint I have about Apple Music is my inability to find a good playlist I feel like Spotify was really good about making playlists based on a song
apple music enthusiasts win again
I m glad I got Apple Music too
Apple TV and MLB are perfect partners Apple TV is the home of Severance a show about a man who compartmentalizes his life to forget about his wife s dying MLB is the home of a league that is dying

Apple flexing at this point with the new chip
Apple Silicon makes Moore s Law relevant again AppleEvent
Stop buying apple products rich get richer
Apple loyalist here Thus far I think these events are losing their luster Beautifully produced but incremental product adds just don t feel as newsworthy Anyone else feel this way AppleEvent
spotify acting up so i finally activated my free 7 day trail of Apple Music
YouTube music on top And Apple Music there about the same
Apple is hella overrated man they do these annual events and the products don t even change or improve lol
Apple is just flexing at this point with this brand new M1 Ultra chip AppleEvent
Apple Music it is then lmao
Apple TV is available on any device with access to the internet including PCs running Windows
Gotta wonder if they marketing team at Apple thought of MK Ultra when they named the new best chip M1 Ultra Also
Apple just keeps adding cooler words to the end of M1 and calling it a new thing
Spotify is down quick switch over to
Apple be hyping everything lol
AAPL iPhone 13 Apple also announced two all new beautiful colors for iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 alpine green and green
It s a broader problem with most mainstream family experiences Spotify family is billed through one credit card all streaming services billed through one card not to mention treating watching as if everyone watches alone Key decision makers only picture a nuclear family
if i was king of apple i would have simply sent out an email to sum up the first 20 minutes of this event
AAPL iPhone SE Apple announced iPhone SE a powerful new iPhone in an iconic design with exceptional capabilities and performance at an incredible price iPhone SE comes in a compact and durable design and together with iOS 15 delivers a seamless user experience
AAPL Apple announces the new iPhone SE details iPhone 13 lineup
The most impressive thing about these Apple events isn t the products it s the show itself Apple is a video making powerhouse AppleEvent

Thank you QUEEN for the support and thank you to your fans who messaged in with their requests Happy InternationalWomenDay2022
it s the Apple event that s crashing discord lol
They prolly think I m Russian Only thing I m rushin is back to Apple Music lol
Most noticeable observation is the lack of wildly cool intro around Apple Park and a lack of real enthusiasm and pizzazz AppleEvent
Pretty standard and normal Apple Event so far No peek performance yet
AAPL Apple and Major League Baseball MLB today announced Friday Night Baseball a weekly doubleheader with live pre and postgame shows that will be available to fans in eight countries exclusively on Apple TV as soon as the regular season begins

Thank you soo much
Apple raised the price os the iPhone SE to 429 from 399 For the stronger chip I guess 30 is worth it AppleEvent
discord doesn t want me to shitpost during the apple direct lol
Apple apparently absolutely must maintain its own app store to maintain its high standards of safety and ethics but for some mysterious reason it absolutely can t run its own factories which would let it end forced labor and other sweatshop conditions 31
If Apple pushes Apple Music over rival music apps how can you tell which music app is best This is a policy that can only be successfully managed from deep inside Plato s Cave where the objective truth of all things is revealed without ambiguity 19
That means that Microsoft can control the lion s share of the sale of games and also compete with the games studios whose wares it sells Apple can do the same for apps and Google and Facebook can do it for ads FB also wants to do it for VR 14
That s where the debate over tech has arrived at the idea that we must preserve giants like Facebook and Google and Apple and Amazon to continue to derive the benefits they deliver and that only the great geniuses at their helms are qualified to lead them 5
Apple shouldn t have accepted it in the first place
Love Apple getting into baseball broadcasts If we have baseball
I swear Apple s cinematography is one thing but their cuts feel pacing is as good as it gets
